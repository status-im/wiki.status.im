# Status - a Mobile Ethereum OS

Status is a free (libre) and open source mobile client targeting Android & iOS built, entirely on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) technologies.

Thanks to the new protocols Ethereum has introduced, there's a whole new ecosystem of applications being developed that are completely decentralised (also known as DApps), and Status aims to provide a user interface to access them. These decentralized applications remove the need for middlemen and centralised servers, providing a clear path forward towards an internet where users get to own their own data, and an economy built on permissionless, open protocols.

It is our belief that messengers are evolving into a new type of OS, and are becoming gateways to our economies and social lives. Status uses messaging as a platform, and by combining both a messenger and a browser we are building a gateway for everyday smartphone users to begin using DApps, and a simple way for DApp developers to reach new users.

Status runs `go-ethereum` directly from your mobile device, providing a mobile Ethereum node in your pocket!

We've love for you to join our community, and be a part of this exciting journey.

## Why?
**We believe in a medium of free interaction, economies with permissionless fair-access and a world without parasitic intermediaries. **
- We want to create protocols and policies that can scale, from small interactions between friends and groups to truly global communication. At the heart of our belief is the ability for individuals to communicate securely without being inhibited by legacy systems or antiquated beliefs.
- We want to empower everyone to take control of their digital lives and responsibility for their own data. We want the way we conduct ourselves privately and publicly to recommend itself to a mass audience; and for the tools we build and the way we use them to improve the lives of everyone.
- We want deep insights into our societies and our own economies so we can make informed, data-driven decisions on what truly makes lives better. The Ethereum blockchain, distributed aplications, Swarm and Whisper provide us with a clear path forward.

If this interests you, **help us make Status a reality** - anyone can contribute and we need everyone at any skill level to participate.


## How to Contribute?

Navigate to the Contributing menu item above, [join our Community Slack](http://slack.status.im), or choose what interests you:

- **Developer**  
Developers are the heart of software and to keep Status beating we need all the help we can get. If you're looking to code in ClojureScript or Golang then Status is the project for you! We use React Native and there is even some Java/Objective-C too!  
Want to learn more about it? Start by reading our [Developer Introduction](http://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/introduction/) which guides you through the technology stack and and start browsing [beginner issues](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner). Then you can read how to [Build Status](http://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/building-status/), which talks about managing project dependencies, coding guidelines and testing procedures.  

- **Community Management**  
Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system - without community Status is meaningless. We're looking to create a positive, fun environment to explore new ideas, experiment and grow the Status community. Building a community takes a lot of work, but the people you'll meet and long lasting relationships you'll form makes it all worthwhile. Check out our guide on [how to grow our Community](community/how-to-grow-our-community.md)

- **Specification / Documentation**  
John Dewey once said "Education is not preparation for life; education is life *itself* ". Developers & Designers need guidance and it all starts from documentation and specifications. Our software is only as good as its documentation, head over to our [wiki](https://wiki.status.im) and see how you can improve what we have.

- **Blog Writing**  
Content is King; keeping [our blog](https://blog.status.im) up to date and informing the community of news helps keep everyone on the same page. We're looking for contributions via guest posts, interviews, progress reports, and are completely open to other ideas. [Jump on our Slack](http://slack.status.im) and discuss with Carl how you can contribute.

- **Outreach / Marketing**  
In this day and age attention is limited, we need all the help we can get to find people who are interested in Status, whether that be through paid user acquisition, public relations or community otherreach, check out our [Outreach' Guide](contributing/outreach.md) to see how you can spread the word and grow our community.

- **Testers**  
It's bug hunting season! Status is currently in Alpha and there are sure to be a bunch of education, [grab your fresh copy of Status](http://TODO) and shake your phone to submit bug reports, or start browsing our [Github Issues](http://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues). Every bug you find brings Status closer to stable, usable software for everyone to enjoy!

- **Security**  
Status is a visual interface to make permanent changes on the Blockchain, it handles crypto-tokens that have real value and allows 3rd party code execution. Security is paramount to its success. You are given permission to break Status as hard as you can, as long as you share your findings with the community!

- **Design & User Experience**  
It's all about that sex appeal, we want cryptocurrencies to be easy and fun to use, ugly software doesn't help adoption. [Check out our designs](https://TODO) and show us how to make them better!

- **Translations**  
Our goal is to make Status available to everyone. We current support ~30 languages within the app, but if you see something weird in the translations or would like to help us add a new translations, [read our Translation Guide](contributing/translations.md). Our website is currently only available in English, and if you'd like to help us make this multi-lingual it's be greatly appreciated, please ask us about it [on Slack](http://slack.status.im).

- **Evangelism**  
Help us spread the word! Tell a friend *right now*, infact tell **everyone** - yell from a mountain if you have to, every person counts!

## Give me Binaries!

Currently the fastest way to get your hands on a binary is to join our Early Access by submitting your email on our [Home Page](https://status.im), or by [building it yourself](contributing/development/building-status.md). We'll be continually rolling out new invites for early supporters of the project, before a public-release once Status is in a more stable state. Nightly builds for Android can be found on our [Artifactory](http://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/).

// TODO GPlay, TestFlight Instructions & FDroid

## The Roadmap

Here is our current roadmap, note that the version numbers in this roadmap might not correlate with features as we are switching to a 'rolling release' cycle much like the Linux kernel, instead of feature based releases.
