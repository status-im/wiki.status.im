            "text": "User Guide\n\n\nSetting It All Up\n\n\nSpecial thanks to \n@cryptowanderer\n for contributing this fantastic guide!\n\n\nWelcome to Status! This is Ethereum, anywhere. Ethereum everywhere. A world computer in your pocket. It is so many cool and amazing things that is difficult to know where to start. Being entirely too overwhelmed with the awesomeness that is an Ethereum light client running on your mobile phone, I suppose we\u2019ll just begin at the beginning.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the app, installed it and opened it, it should take you into a chat with Console: a dApp that lives inside status and lets you set up your account and control all the important stuff (as well as a bunch of other rad features, which we will get to in good time).\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, I have already been chatting a fair bit with Console (friends, yay!!). The UI concept here is that when someone sends an action message requesting (in this case) a password, or money, or a confirmation code etc., you can tap the blue block and it will insert the appropriate syntax to respond to that request, followed by your input. \n\n\nOne other thing to note is the \u2018Available\u2019 beneath \u2018Console\u2019 in the top left. This means that my phone has synced with the ropsten testnet (unbelievable right?!). I am running android 7.0 and am doing so over wifi. It took just under 40mins for me to sync, though there are varying reports coming in to our slack depending on phone, OS and network differences. Still, ~40min sync time on a mobile is just insane. Thanks Zsolt for the amazing \nLES\n!\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that you can optionally give your phone number to help status sync with your existing contacts. This is not mandatory and the app will work fine without it. If you do provide it, please make sure to give your country code (so +27\u2026 for me) so that status can send you the confirmation message. Note that if you run into any issues, you can just shake your phone and this should bring up a screen that allows you to submit an error report directly to the status team. You can select from the options what you want to do, but generally it seems best to \nReport a Problem\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to select a colour to indicate the severity of the issue on the second screen above. I really want to make sure that Jarrad, Carl and the crew are on their toes, so I have gone for red here. Hitting the forward button (top right) should take you to where the magic really happens:\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the \nTake a screen recording\n button in the bottom left. This is how the team prefers you to submit bug reports as it is enormously helpful with seeing exactly what went wrong and so providing insight into where to go to fix the issue. You can enter your email, take a video and go ahead and submit. At which point we issue you a massive thank you for being such a stellar alpha tester. Go you!\n\n\nActually Using the App\n\n\nOK, now that we have the setup out the way, we can get into the really fun stuff. Once you have generated your account with Console, you can open both the ropsten testnet faucet and the status test faucet to get some shweet test ether into your account so that you can go out and convince actual people to be your friends too. Please do not open an issue if this doesn\u2019t happen - we can\u2019t convince people to like you (even if you do use the best tech around).\n\n\nTo open both faucets, tap the hamburger menu with the blue dot to the left of the chat box:\n\n\n\n\nIn words, we tap the menu on the left, scroll down and select the faucet option and then select which testnet we want to get ether from. Repeat this twice to open both faucets and you should get a bit more ether a bit more quickly. Don\u2019t worry about the web3 stuff in the first screenshot - we\u2019ll get to that (who said you can\u2019t build suspense in a technical user guide?).\n\n\nSeeing as we\u2019re now finished chatting to Console for the moment, we can hit the back button and this will take us into the Chats page:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see all the lovely people that you have been chatting to. It\u2019s really straightforward and intuitive, so behave as you normally would in WhatsApp or WeChat etc. Tapping a conversation will take you into it, and you can use the bottom three tabs to navigate through the Chats, Discover and Contacts screen. You can also just swipe right. Just do you.\n\n\nThere is another important dApp that lives here as well - your wallet. Selecting it should take you to a screen like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe main screen opens what is essentially an in-app browser that will show your main balance. You can scroll that screen down using the small down arrow at the top in the centre to see the actual transactions in a chat-like interface. As you can see, I am super rich - absolutely rolling in that test ether - and have sent some to Jarrad as mad props for building the app, and received some from Roland as a little test.\n\n\nIf you navigate back out of the wallet chat and swipe right, or select the Discover tab at the bottom, you will get to the Discover page:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see hashtags people are using and discover all the different conversations going on. Swipe right through the cards to see the most popular categories, or scroll down to see the most recent updates. If you want to make a message of your own appear here, you need to open your profile page and edit your status with the hashtag you want to see appear here. Start a meme or hop onto an existing one - it\u2019s all up to you. You can get to your profile page by tapping the little hamburger menu in the very top left of the app:\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t stress about the \nSettings\n tab - that will be functional in a later release. Your profile page should look like the below. To edit it, hit the three dots in the top right:\n\n\n\n\nTap next to your name to edit that, tap your status to edit that and hit the pencil icon by the picture to upload your own. Remember to include that hashtag if you want it to appear on the Discover page.\n\n\nOnce that is all done and you\u2019ve broadcast a status for all the world to see, swipe right once more (or use the tabs for navigation) and you will get to the Contacts page. Here you will see the dApps that are currently living in status as well as all the wonderful people you have connected with:\n\n\n\n\nThese dApps all work in essentially the same way as the wallet - you can open a chat with them, which will direct you to an in app browser that displays whatever is appropriate for that app. There is a small down arrow at the top which you can scroll down to see any transactions that have occurred between you and the dApp. Directly from within status - signed, sealed and delivered, it all just works. Mind-boggling, I know.\n\n\n\n\nIf you close your app or otherwise have an issue, when you reopen it, you should be directed to  a screen which looks like the below. Select the account that belongs to you (in the case where you set up more than one) and then put in the appropriate password and you should get back to the chat screen:\n\n\n\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work for you or your account doesn\u2019t appear like mine, hit the \nRecover access\n button at the bottom of the first screen and follow the prompts to input the 12 word passphrase console gave you when you first set stuff up and your password.\n\n\nHappy sailing!\n\n\nFor the Adventurous\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered all the basic functionality as it stands, but there is so much more that you can do with status. Most of this stuff will only become available in the beta release or after, but developers around the world should be getting really excited to start building dApps to live alongside Flight Delays and Maker etc. \n\n\nThough it is by no means complete yet, you can do a lot more than just set you account up using Console - it is, after all, a full dApp of its own. Go back to that chat and type \nweb3.\n (the fullstop is important) and \nweb3.eth.\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see a whole bunch of suggestions for the sorts of things you can do directly from Console, the most basic of which is \nweb3.eth.blockNumber\n which will return the current block number on the ropsten testnet. If this doesn\u2019t blow your mind, I\u2019m not sure what will. There are, as I said, still improvements to be made here regarding technical things like retaining state between messages, but it will get there.\n\n\nIf you want to dive in even further and help develop the app, contribute some code or otherwise get involved in the technical side of things, here are the links you need:\n\n\nHow to build it: \nhttps://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/building-status/\n\n\nThe latest nightlies: \nhttp://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/\n\n\nIf you would like to help us with how to build for Linux and Windows, please do feel free - that would be really awesome to get everyone up to the same speed.",

            "text": "Special thanks to  @cryptowanderer  for contributing this fantastic guide!  Welcome to Status! This is Ethereum, anywhere. Ethereum everywhere. A world computer in your pocket. It is so many cool and amazing things that is difficult to know where to start. Being entirely too overwhelmed with the awesomeness that is an Ethereum light client running on your mobile phone, I suppose we\u2019ll just begin at the beginning.  Once you have downloaded the app, installed it and opened it, it should take you into a chat with Console: a dApp that lives inside status and lets you set up your account and control all the important stuff (as well as a bunch of other rad features, which we will get to in good time).   As you can see, I have already been chatting a fair bit with Console (friends, yay!!). The UI concept here is that when someone sends an action message requesting (in this case) a password, or money, or a confirmation code etc., you can tap the blue block and it will insert the appropriate syntax to respond to that request, followed by your input.   One other thing to note is the \u2018Available\u2019 beneath \u2018Console\u2019 in the top left. This means that my phone has synced with the ropsten testnet (unbelievable right?!). I am running android 7.0 and am doing so over wifi. It took just under 40mins for me to sync, though there are varying reports coming in to our slack depending on phone, OS and network differences. Still, ~40min sync time on a mobile is just insane. Thanks Zsolt for the amazing  LES !   You can see that you can optionally give your phone number to help status sync with your existing contacts. This is not mandatory and the app will work fine without it. If you do provide it, please make sure to give your country code (so +27\u2026 for me) so that status can send you the confirmation message. Note that if you run into any issues, you can just shake your phone and this should bring up a screen that allows you to submit an error report directly to the status team. You can select from the options what you want to do, but generally it seems best to  Report a Problem :   You should be able to select a colour to indicate the severity of the issue on the second screen above. I really want to make sure that Jarrad, Carl and the crew are on their toes, so I have gone for red here. Hitting the forward button (top right) should take you to where the magic really happens:   Please note the  Take a screen recording  button in the bottom left. This is how the team prefers you to submit bug reports as it is enormously helpful with seeing exactly what went wrong and so providing insight into where to go to fix the issue. You can enter your email, take a video and go ahead and submit. At which point we issue you a massive thank you for being such a stellar alpha tester. Go you!",

            "text": "OK, now that we have the setup out the way, we can get into the really fun stuff. Once you have generated your account with Console, you can open both the ropsten testnet faucet and the status test faucet to get some shweet test ether into your account so that you can go out and convince actual people to be your friends too. Please do not open an issue if this doesn\u2019t happen - we can\u2019t convince people to like you (even if you do use the best tech around).  To open both faucets, tap the hamburger menu with the blue dot to the left of the chat box:   In words, we tap the menu on the left, scroll down and select the faucet option and then select which testnet we want to get ether from. Repeat this twice to open both faucets and you should get a bit more ether a bit more quickly. Don\u2019t worry about the web3 stuff in the first screenshot - we\u2019ll get to that (who said you can\u2019t build suspense in a technical user guide?).  Seeing as we\u2019re now finished chatting to Console for the moment, we can hit the back button and this will take us into the Chats page:   Here you can see all the lovely people that you have been chatting to. It\u2019s really straightforward and intuitive, so behave as you normally would in WhatsApp or WeChat etc. Tapping a conversation will take you into it, and you can use the bottom three tabs to navigate through the Chats, Discover and Contacts screen. You can also just swipe right. Just do you.  There is another important dApp that lives here as well - your wallet. Selecting it should take you to a screen like this:   The main screen opens what is essentially an in-app browser that will show your main balance. You can scroll that screen down using the small down arrow at the top in the centre to see the actual transactions in a chat-like interface. As you can see, I am super rich - absolutely rolling in that test ether - and have sent some to Jarrad as mad props for building the app, and received some from Roland as a little test.  If you navigate back out of the wallet chat and swipe right, or select the Discover tab at the bottom, you will get to the Discover page:   Here you can see hashtags people are using and discover all the different conversations going on. Swipe right through the cards to see the most popular categories, or scroll down to see the most recent updates. If you want to make a message of your own appear here, you need to open your profile page and edit your status with the hashtag you want to see appear here. Start a meme or hop onto an existing one - it\u2019s all up to you. You can get to your profile page by tapping the little hamburger menu in the very top left of the app:   Don\u2019t stress about the  Settings  tab - that will be functional in a later release. Your profile page should look like the below. To edit it, hit the three dots in the top right:   Tap next to your name to edit that, tap your status to edit that and hit the pencil icon by the picture to upload your own. Remember to include that hashtag if you want it to appear on the Discover page.  Once that is all done and you\u2019ve broadcast a status for all the world to see, swipe right once more (or use the tabs for navigation) and you will get to the Contacts page. Here you will see the dApps that are currently living in status as well as all the wonderful people you have connected with:   These dApps all work in essentially the same way as the wallet - you can open a chat with them, which will direct you to an in app browser that displays whatever is appropriate for that app. There is a small down arrow at the top which you can scroll down to see any transactions that have occurred between you and the dApp. Directly from within status - signed, sealed and delivered, it all just works. Mind-boggling, I know.   If you close your app or otherwise have an issue, when you reopen it, you should be directed to  a screen which looks like the below. Select the account that belongs to you (in the case where you set up more than one) and then put in the appropriate password and you should get back to the chat screen:   If that doesn\u2019t work for you or your account doesn\u2019t appear like mine, hit the  Recover access  button at the bottom of the first screen and follow the prompts to input the 12 word passphrase console gave you when you first set stuff up and your password.  Happy sailing!",

            "text": "We\u2019ve covered all the basic functionality as it stands, but there is so much more that you can do with status. Most of this stuff will only become available in the beta release or after, but developers around the world should be getting really excited to start building dApps to live alongside Flight Delays and Maker etc.   Though it is by no means complete yet, you can do a lot more than just set you account up using Console - it is, after all, a full dApp of its own. Go back to that chat and type  web3.  (the fullstop is important) and  web3.eth. :   You should be able to see a whole bunch of suggestions for the sorts of things you can do directly from Console, the most basic of which is  web3.eth.blockNumber  which will return the current block number on the ropsten testnet. If this doesn\u2019t blow your mind, I\u2019m not sure what will. There are, as I said, still improvements to be made here regarding technical things like retaining state between messages, but it will get there.

            "text": "FAQ\n\n\nWhy a Messenger?\n\n\nWhen Carl \n Jarrad looked at how to achieve mass adoption for a client. We looked at things such as where the people are, how they behave on their devices, time spent on pc vs mobile - as of 2014 more time is spent on mobile than desktop, and of that time - a THIRD of it is spent within Instant Messengers.\n\n\nInstant Messengers have the highest retention rates, that is when you purchase an install, they become sticky and typically users won't immediately uninstall. \n\n\nThe average user lifetime sky rockets once their friends are involved. When you start thinking about this as a user base and how to connect that with Ethereum, things like payments and applications built ontop of Ethereum integrated into a converstional interface starts becoming like a clear path forward.\n\n\nUltimately we're building a hybrid browser and messenger for us to have the best chance to cast the widest net and focus on user acquisition, staying agnostic and as close as possible to the principles Ethereum embodies.\n\n\nDoes Status support DApps that have their own web page ?\n\n\nYes, we absolutely support DApps on their own webpage and are striving for SWARM support also. Chances are, if a DApp works in Mist or MetaMask it is likely to work in Status!\n\n\nOur goal is to be a DApp browser for Android \n iOS, in addition to this we'll support a Chat API if you wish to integrate within a chat context.\n\n\nIf your web-based DApp renders on mobile, trying using the \n!browse\n command inside a chat and navigating to your DApp URL! During our alpha release, DApp developers can also add their DApps as default contacts by following \nthese instructions\n, but in later releases these will be discoverable to uses through the Discover feature.\n\n\nCan your app be launched with a link?\n\n\nNot at the moment, the standard we will likely support is \nEIP67\n.\n\n\nDo I have to run go-ethereum myself or on server?\n\n\nStatus includes \ngo-ethereum\n and connects directly to the Ethereum network. All you need to do is run the Status app! This is possible to do with the new Light Client Protocol.\n\n\nWhen did you start coding and how you are funded?\n\n\nStatus is largely self-funded.  We've been working on it since prior Devcon1, and we were awarded a Devgrant to port EthereumJ to Android prior to that.\n\n\nEthereumJ has different goals, its developers intended for server use and had no interest in supporting the light client protocol, another large factor is we wanted largely a single codebase for multiple platforms, we had Java running on iOS and Android, we want unify the GUI but the means to do that (JavaFX) is really not suited to mobile devices. \n\n\nOur current approach allows us to get bleeding edge tech and stability of geth whilst maintaining a single codebase.\n\n\nI am new to Ethereum \n Blockchain. I would like to contribute to the project, where would you suggest I start?\n\n\nTo get up to speed with Ethereum, here are a few resources to get you started:\n\n\nEthdocs.org\n,\n\nEthereum.org\n, \n\nEthereum Stack Exchange\n, and \n\nEthereum on Youtube\n\n\nFor Status - please take a look under the \nContributing Section\n, and ask us about it \non Slack\n (we're friendly people!)\n\n\nI have a DApp that runs on Mist how can I test it in Status?\n\n\nSo each chat context has a command !browse - allowing users to access a webview (you can imagine this as a bit like a browser tab), so much in the same way as mist. In terms of integration/compatibility nothing is required on your end to do that if it already works in Mist.\n\n\nThat said, looking beyond the alpha, we'll have developer tooling, and a way for DApp developers to have profiles for theirs DApps (this then makes them discoverable through the 'Discover' feature), along with the Chat API for Developers who want to integrate through a conversational UI rather than (or in addition to) webview.\n\n\nWhat is the \"jail\" in your status-react code?\n\n\nWhen the Chat API is ready to use, your javascript code is executed in Otto VM  \nhttps://github.com/robertkrimen/otto\n  this is the same javascript engine \ngo-ethereum\n uses. That way your code is executed in a \"jail\" and shouldn't interfere with the rest of Status. At least, that's the theory, at the moment we have no implementation of the halting problem, but we will.\n\n\nFor web DApps, we rely on the webview to correctly jail javascript.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to see the Beta?\n\n\nThe first release of our alpha was at the very beginning of Q1 2017, beta will come end of Q1 or early Q2 2017 with developer tooling, bug fixes \n the ability for DApps to integrate within a chat context.\n\n\nIs it going to be for Android only?\n\n\nNo, we support Android \n iOS.\n\n\nIs it possible to install Status \n how can I test?\n\n\nAt the moment you have to \nbuild it yourself\n, we are just fixing some bugs before first alpha release to the early access subscribers which signed up on our website \nhttps://status.im\n - alternatively there are some binaries floating around the Slack now.\n\n\nSoon we'll have our alpha test on Google Play \n Testflight. Currently Status has been tested on:\n\n\n\n\nLG Nexus 5X\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Nexus\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy A3\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy A5\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge\n\n\nMotorola G3\n\n\niPhone 5\n\n\niPhone 6S\n\n\niPhone 7\n\n\n\n\nWhat languages do you support?\n\n\nWe\u2019re currently supporting 30 languages\u200a\u2014\u200athis includes; English, \u5b98\u8a71, \u5b98\u8bdd, \u5ee3\u6771\u8a71, \u4e0a\u6d77\u8bdd, Nederlands, Fran\u00e7ais, Deutsch, \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940, Magyar, Italiano, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4, Polski, Portugu\u00eas brasileiro, Portugu\u00eas europeu, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, Slovenski, Espa\u00f1ol, Espa\u00f1ol (Latin-America), Swahili, Svenska, Suisse fran\u00e7aise, Schweizerdeutsch, Svizzera Italiana, \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22, T\u00fcrk\u00e7e, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648 \n Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t!\n\n\nIf you see a typo, mistranslation or something missing, don't hesitate to let us know \nvia the Status Slack\n, or fix it yourself using our \nTranslation Guide!\n\n\nWhat about all these permissions in the app?\n\n\nPermissions are always a hot topic for apps, we hate the way we\u2019re doing them too. The good news is it\u2019s only like this for alpha and in production we\u2019ll make permission usage on-demand.

We don\u2019t use them unless you tap on the phone sync request message.  \n\n\nLocation\n\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrently used for our toy !location command. Our aim is to provide this to DApps For things like sharing location with friends, ordering food, or self-driving cars.  \n\n\nMicrophone\n\u200a\u2014\u200aIn this version, we don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s there because we intended to send audio messages over Whisper, in practice this was a bad idea. We still intend to offer Audio messages in Beta so it\u2019s going to stay. It is also used in Instabug which we use to collect feedback.  \n\n\nStorage\n\u200a\u2014\u200aWe need a place to put the blockchain data.  \n\n\nCamera\n\u200a\u2014\u200aWe use this for setting your profile picture and for reading QR codes.  \n\n\nWhere are the nightlies?\n\n\nHere you go!\n\nhttp://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/",

The good news is it\u2019s only like this for alpha and in production we\u2019ll make permission usage on-demand. At the moment there\u2019s many moving parts and a bunch of react-native dependencies (and Instabug) which don\u2019t have code to ask on-demand. Thanks for understanding!  Contacts, SMS, Telephone \u200a\u2014\u200athese are for an optional step of phone contact synchronisation. We don\u2019t use them unless you tap on the phone sync request message.    Location \u200a\u2014\u200aCurrently used for our toy !location command. Our aim is to provide this to DApps For things like sharing location with friends, ordering food, or self-driving cars.    Microphone \u200a\u2014\u200aIn this version, we don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s there because we intended to send audio messages over Whisper, in practice this was a bad idea. We still intend to offer Audio messages in Beta so it\u2019s going to stay. It is also used in Instabug which we use to collect feedback.    Storage \u200a\u2014\u200aWe need a place to put the blockchain data.    Camera \u200a\u2014\u200aWe use this for setting your profile picture and for reading QR codes.",

If you would like more practical tips and suggestions please read on \nhow to grow our Community\n.\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\nStatus is about showing humanity to one another: the word itself captures the spirit of being human.\n\n\nWe want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome new ideas in a complex field, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and skills.\n\n\nWe gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the project.\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the project will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the project officially or informally, claims affiliation with the project, or participates directly.\n\n\nWe strive to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReciprocate\n \n\nNothing is more important than to show appreciation for every and anyones contributions, big or small. We show reciprocation by saying thank-you, contributing ourselves or paying it forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe considerate\n \n\nOur work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe respectful\n\nDisagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake responsibility for our words and our actions\n\nWe can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe collaborative\n\nWhat we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.\n\n\nCollaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue decisiveness, clarity and consensus\n\nDisagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.\n\n\nWe expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for help when unsure\n\nNobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep down considerately\n\nWhen somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership, authority and responsibility\n\n\nWe all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project. Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself.\n\n\nDelegation from the top\n\n\nWe are exploring the alternative governence models that Ethereum can facilitate, but for the time being responsibility for the project starts with the \"benevolent dictator\", who delegates specific responsibilities and the corresponding authority to a series of teams, councils and individuals, starting with the Community Council (\"CC\"). That Council or its delegated representative will arbitrate in any dispute.\n\n\nWe are a meritocracy; we delegate decision making, governance and leadership from senior bodies to the most able and engaged candidates.\n\n\nSupport for delegation is measured\n\n\nNominations to the boards and councils are at the discretion of the Community Council, however the Community Council will seek the input of the community before confirming appointments.\n\n\nLeadership is not an award, right, or title; it is a privilege, a responsibility and a mandate. A leader will only retain their authority as long as they retain the support of those who delegated that authority to them.\n\n\nWe value discussion, data and decisiveness\n\n\nWe gather opinions, data and commitments from concerned parties before taking a decision. We expect leaders to help teams come to a decision in a reasonable time, to seek guidance or be willing to take the decision themselves when consensus is lacking, and to take responsibility for implementation.\n\n\nThe poorest decision of all is no decision: clarity of direction has value in itself. Sometimes all the data are not available, or consensus is elusive. A decision must still be made. There is no guarantee of a perfect decision every time - we prefer to err, learn, and err less in future than to postpone action indefinitely.\n\n\nWe recognise that the project works better when we trust the teams closest to a problem to make the decision for the project. If we learn of a decision that we disagree with, we can engage the relevant team to find common ground, and failing that, we have a governance structure that can review the decision. Ultimately, if a decision has been taken by the people responsible for it, and is supported by the project governance, it will stand. None of us expects to agree with every decision, and we value highly the willingness to stand by the project and help it deliver even on the occasions when we ourselves may prefer a different route.\n\n\nOpen meritocracy\n\n\nWe invite anybody, from any company, to participate in any aspect of the project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.\n\n\nTeamwork\n\n\nA leader's foremost goal is the success of the team.\n\n\n\"A virtuoso is judged by their actions; a leader is judged by the actions of their team.\" A leader knows when to act and when to step back. They know when to delegate work, and when to take it upon themselves.\n\n\nCredit\n\n\nA good leader does not seek the limelight, but celebrates team members for the work they do. Leaders may be more visible than members of the team, good ones use that visibility to highlight the great work of others.\n\n\nCourage and considerateness\n\n\nLeadership occasionally requires bold decisions that will not be widely understood, consensual or popular. We value the courage to take such decisions, because they enable the project as a whole to move forward faster than we could if we required complete consensus. Nevertheless, boldness demands considerateness; take bold decisions, but do so mindful of the challenges they present for others, and work to soften the impact of those decisions on them. Communicating changes and their reasoning clearly and early on is as important as the implementation of the change itself.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\n\n\nWe expect leaders to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and abstain or delegate decisions that may be seen to be self-interested. We expect that everyone who participates in the project does so with the goal of making life better for its users.\n\n\nWhen in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or favourable to the interests of one group over another.\n\n\nThis Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.\n\n\nThe Status Code of Conduct is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license and has been appropriated from the Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0.

I'll talk about the rational behind these design decisions and link to offsite resources on learning each of these technologies.\n\n\nReact Native\n\n\nStatus (formerly known as Syng) has always aspired to have a single, unified codebase for multi-platform development. This is not so easy to achieve, as many of the non-web-based solutions out there allow you to have a semi-single codebase, but you find yourself creating a lot of seperate logic for handling user interfaces on each platform - Status is 80% frontend code and this presents a problem. We tried Xamarin \n Java (EthereumJ was the first implementation we got running on Android \n iOS - via RoboVM), and we quickly discovered this problem.\n\n\nMobile apps built on web-based technologies, such as those done in Cordova, are great for short-term projects or mvp, but you will quickly run into performance issues on resource-limited devices and may need to rewrite you app. In our tests displaying webview DApps in a chat history with iFrames and all the other bells and whistles we wanted turned out to be a futile effort.\n\n\nThat limited our options to choosing between NativeScript \n React Native. We chose React Native because it is more mature and is being used in production for popular apps like \nFacebook\n, \nInstagram\n, \nAirbnb\n, \nBaidu\n \n \nDiscord\n. This gave us the impression that this framework was here to stay with many Fortune 500 companies invested in its continuance.\n\n\nAt this point all we had to do is merge Material \n iOS design into our unique look'and'feel so that we could minimise the amount of Android \n iOS specific code. Our amazing designer \nAndrei Mironov\n elegantly solved the rest of that puzzle.\n\n\nReact Native Learning Resources\n\n\nIf you would like to start learning React Native, check out these resources:\n\n\n\n\nUse React Native\n\n\nReact Native Docs\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you might want to continue reading and learn more about \nre-natal\n, \nre-frame\n \n \nreagent\n.\n\n\nClojurescript\n\n\n\u201cLisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.\u201d\n \u2014 \nEric Raymond\n.\n\n\nTo read more quotes on Lisp read \nLisp, made with secret alien technology\n.\n\n\n  \n\n\nThere's alot of resources online about why learning Lisps are so great. For us, it's largely about culture; we like the way Lispers think. We want functional programming, macros, homoiconic code and the flexibility that comes with a simple, unstructured language in which to think. The benefits of this become more apparent in later stage development, where functional language allows us to perform rewrites more easily, isolate many bugs to specific functions, as well as enforcing correct coding. Also, I prefer reading it.\n\n\nMoreover, with \nhiccup\n, working with React Native markup becomes a dream.\n\n\nClojurescript Learning Resources\n\n\nIf you would like to start learning Clojurescript, check out these resources:\n\n\n\n\nClojurescript FAQ (for JavaScript developers)\n\n\nClojurescript Community Resources\n\n\nClojurescript Unraveled Book (Free)\n\n\n/r/clojure\n \n \n/r/clojurescript\n\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\nOf all the Ethereum implementations \ngo-ethereum\n has received the most love and implements the newest and best features. Without \ngo-ethereum\n we couldn't use the light client protocol and Status would not be possible. We will also get access to Swarm the fastest. We consume \ngo-ethereum\n as a library in \nstatus-go\n.\n\n\n'Nough said.\n\n\nRe-natal\n\n\nre-natal is an invaluable tool to that automates the setup of your \nre-frame\n React Native for Android \n iOS, it includes \nfigwheel\n for easy development.\n\n\n\n\nre-natal \nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nRe-frame\n\n\nre-frame is simple but expressive library for writing Single Page Applications in ClojureScript, using \nReagent\n. It is a functional framework for reactive 'MVC-style' applications. To learn more:\n\n\n\n\nre-frame \nREADME.md\n\n\nre-frame \ndocs\n\n\nA Noob's walkthrough of a re-frame Application\n\n\nThe Angular Phonecat tutorial in re-frame\n\n\n\n\nReagent\n\n\nReagent\n provides a minimalistic interface between ClojureScript and React. It allows you to define efficient React components using nothing but plain ClojureScript functions and data, that describe your UI using a Hiccup-like syntax.\nThe goal of Reagent is to make it possible to define arbitrarily complex UIs using just a couple of basic concepts, and to be fast enough by default that you rarely have to care about performance.\n\n\n\n\nReagent website\n\n\nReagent \nREADME.md\n\n\nBuilding Single Page Apps with Reagent\n\n\nYou should be using Figwheel \n Reagent. Here's why\n\n\nReagent Rocks\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Status\n\n\nRead our guide on how to Build Status\n\n\nFinding issues to work on\n\n\nSo by now you should have a general sense of the tech that goes into Status, managed to get Status built \n running and want to find something to sink your teeth into. \n\n\nThe best place to look for tasks to work on is our \nGithub Issues\n. We've labelled the tasks by our estimated difficulty.\n\n\nClick the labels below to see what is available.\n\n\nBeginner Issues\n\n\n\n\nThese are tickets we believe anyone willing to learn Clojurescript can handle. They involve minor UI and localisation changes. Even though they may seem minor that have a huge impact on the usability of Status.\n\n\nIntermediate Issues\n\n\n\n\nBeginner too easy and your Clojure-fu up to par? Time to level up!\nThese issues require a slightly deeper understanding of what Status is trying to accomplish; an understanding of Ethereum; and more communication and intimacy in the Slack as they are interdependent tasks. They involve things like setting up UI tests, fixing nastier bugs and making decisions that will have a real impact on how Status behaves and functions.\n\n\nAdvanced Issues\n\n\n\n\nThese issues are really there for people deeply into Ethereum, Core Contributors and people who believe in Status and have the skills to make magic happen.",

I'll talk about the rational behind these design decisions and link to offsite resources on learning each of these technologies.\n\n\nReact Native\n\n\nStatus (formerly known as Syng) has always aspired to have a single, unified codebase for multi-platform development. This is not so easy to achieve, as many of the non-web-based solutions out there allow you to have a semi-single codebase, but you find yourself creating a lot of seperate logic for handling user interfaces on each platform - Status is 80% frontend code and this presents a problem. We tried Xamarin \n Java (EthereumJ was the first implementation we got running on Android \n iOS - via RoboVM), and we quickly discovered this problem.\n\n\nMobile apps built on web-based technologies, such as those done in Cordova, are great for short-term projects or mvp, but you will quickly run into performance issues on resource-limited devices and may need to rewrite you app. In our tests displaying webview DApps in a chat history with iFrames and all the other bells and whistles we wanted turned out to be a futile effort.\n\n\nThat limited our options to choosing between NativeScript \n React Native. We chose React Native because it is more mature and is being used in production for popular apps like \nFacebook\n, \nInstagram\n, \nAirbnb\n, \nBaidu\n \n \nDiscord\n. This gave us the impression that this framework was here to stay with many Fortune 500 companies invested in its continuance.\n\n\nAt this point all we had to do is merge Material \n iOS design into our unique look'and'feel so that we could minimise the amount of Android \n iOS specific code.

We tried Xamarin   Java (EthereumJ was the first implementation we got running on Android   iOS - via RoboVM), and we quickly discovered this problem.  Mobile apps built on web-based technologies, such as those done in Cordova, are great for short-term projects or mvp, but you will quickly run into performance issues on resource-limited devices and may need to rewrite you app. In our tests displaying webview DApps in a chat history with iFrames and all the other bells and whistles we wanted turned out to be a futile effort.  That limited our options to choosing between NativeScript   React Native. We chose React Native because it is more mature and is being used in production for popular apps like  Facebook ,  Instagram ,  Airbnb ,  Baidu     Discord . This gave us the impression that this framework was here to stay with many Fortune 500 companies invested in its continuance.  At this point all we had to do is merge Material   iOS design into our unique look'and'feel so that we could minimise the amount of Android   iOS specific code. Our amazing designer  Andrei Mironov  elegantly solved the rest of that puzzle.",

To read more quotes on Lisp read  Lisp, made with secret alien technology .      There's alot of resources online about why learning Lisps are so great. For us, it's largely about culture; we like the way Lispers think. We want functional programming, macros, homoiconic code and the flexibility that comes with a simple, unstructured language in which to think. The benefits of this become more apparent in later stage development, where functional language allows us to perform rewrites more easily, isolate many bugs to specific functions, as well as enforcing correct coding.

We truly value contributions that help to improve our documentation; whether that be tutorials for users, additions to the FAQs, or more granular instructions for developers - it all adds up and our community appreciates it :)\n\n\nOur Wiki is powered by MKDocs, and is on: \nhttps://github.com/status-im/wiki.status.im\n, and if you spot any errors, find parts of the documentation confusing, or have some suggestions on how we could have clearer communication we'd love your help, and feel free to let us know via the \nStatus Slack\n.\n\n\nDocumenting Guide\n\n\nIt's fairly difficult to write a general documentation guide as how you document stuff will depend on what it is you are trying to explain. The most basic stuff to know is that MKDocs uses markdown as it's primary language, although you can also write your guides using inline HTML as well. Please go \nhere\n for more detailed info on this, as well as a look at how the file structure of our docs works.\n\n\nGetting Set Up\n\n\nYou need to have both python and pip set up on your machine to install MKDocs. You can find all the information for how to do that and what versions are required \nhere\n. I had python already intalled on my machine, but needed to get pip:\n\n\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\nIt seemed like using \nsudo\n was important otherwise the mkdocs install failed with some nasty stack trace, but that may have been specific to my environment (Mac). Once you have got that all working and  \n\n\nmkdocs --version\n \n\n\nreturns an answer (currently \nmkdocs, version 0.16.1\n), then you can clone into the status repo and get going.\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/status-im/wiki.status.im.git\n \n\n\n(or \ngit clone git@github.com:status-im/wiki.status.im.git\n if you have your SSH keys set up) followed by \n\n\ncd wiki.status.im\nmkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\nYou should then be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000 or http://127.0.0.1:8000 and see the changes you are making to the wiki as you make them. Magic!\n\n\nGeneral Notes on What We Look For\n\n\nGenerally speaking, we like a lot of screenshots and less language as this helps us to guide people all over the world who may not all speak the same languages. Take a look at our \nUser Guide\n for a rough outline of what we mean by balancing your text with screenshots and other helpful images. \n\n\nAs you can see from our \ngithub repo\n all of the different documents are kept in the \ndocs\n directory. Click through to there to find the section and then the specific document you are wanting to add to or edit, or make a new file for documentation that you feel is missing. \n\n\n\n\nIn the top level repo, you can also see an \nmkdocs.yml\n file, which is what controls how and where each document appears. If you are adding a new document, you will need to speak to Jarrad, Carl or another team member to figure out where it belongs, but either way you will need to edit this file in order for it to appear. It is definitely best to communicate with the core team before diving this deep though.\n\n\nAs you can see, I have uploaded a bunch of images into this post (which is largely about encouraging you to use lots of images in your own documentation and explainers). The images are all kept in the \nimg\n directory in each folder within the \ndocs\n directory. You cannot upload straight to these \nimg\n folders as that requires push access to the whole repo, but you can make your own fork of \nwiki.status.im\n and upload the images there to be merged by the team once you have completed your awesome work. To do all this, navigate to the folder you are working in and click the \nFork\n option in the very top right. This will start a new fork of the wiki in your own repo, where you can upload the photos and then later push back to status to be merged.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have forked it and selected where it should go in your profile, you can then add images easily by either dragging and dropping or uploading directly from your machine.\n\n\n\n\nYou can select the first radio button option to commit the uploaded images you need directly onto your own master branch. From there, once you are sure that all the changes you have made are the ones you want to make and look good on the wiki via that neat trick with\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n\n\nthen you can submit a PR to the actual status wiki:\n\n\n\n\nClick the highlighted button near the top right and follow the instructions from there to submit your changes to the status team. You should see a screen something like this where you can review all the changes you have made before actually submitting. For the PR, I have uploaded the photos needed for this post, made two grammatical changes to the User Guide and, obviously enough, uploaded this entire \ndocumenting.md\n file, all of which I can review easily. \n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for adding to our wonderful, free (libre) open source, community-driven effort to bring Ethereum to the people!\n\n\nDocumentation Guidelines\n\n\nThese will evolve as the project does, but really depends on what specific type of documentation you are looking to help out with. For technical documentation, examples and lots of code is what we are primarily looking for; by way of example see the first set up section of this article. For instance, in order to add an image here, you can either use inline html (my preferred option because it is easier to positiona dn style) or the normal markdown way of doing things. The images above are inserted like so:\n\n\ncenter\nimg src=\"../img/status-wiki.png\" /\n/center\n \n\n\nand style tags etc can be added really easily:\n\n\ncenter\nimg src=\"../img/status-wiki.png\" style=\"width:300px\" /\n/center\n\n\nor you can just do it in normal markdown:\n\n\n[![We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics.

A suitable mechanism is one that \n(a)\n uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and \n(b)\n will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne)\n Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Combined Libraries\n\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n\n\n\na)\n Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n\nb)\n Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL EXCEPTION GRANTED BY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n\n\nAs a special exception, copyright holders give you permission to link this\nlibrary with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of\nthe license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute\nthe resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also\nmeet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of\nthe license of that module.
