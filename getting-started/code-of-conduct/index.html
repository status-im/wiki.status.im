<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>This page outlines how you should govern yourself when participating in the Status community. For more practical tips and suggestions on how to help the project and contribute, please refer to either of these guides, <a href="../../community/how-to-grow-our-community/">How to grow our Community</a> or <a href="../docs/contributing/development/introduction.md">Introduction for developers</a>.  </p>
<p>The Code of Conduct serves to establish guidelines on how to conduct your behaviour. We are all responsible for maintaining and developing this shared environment.<br />
We want to have a common productive, collaborative and socially responsible space. We hope that all our community members share our views and nurture this spirit and culture in their dealings with the Status community.  </p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>Status is about showing respect and humanity for one another: the word itself captures the spirit of social esteem in a human community.</p>
<p>We want to grow a productive and agile place that can welcome new ideas in a complex field. We wish to improve every process in every development cycle and foster collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and skills.</p>
<p>We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This Code of Conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment.  </p>
<p>This Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the project will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the project officially or informally, claims affiliation with the project, or participates directly.</p>
<h2 id="we-strive-to">We strive to:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reciprocate</strong> <br />
Nothing is more important than to show appreciation for every and anyones contributions, no matter if big or small. We show reciprocation by saying thank-you, contributing ourselves or paying it forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be considerate</strong> <br />
Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.  </p>
<p>When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feel free to ask</strong><br />
If there's something you don't know, do ask, questions are encouraged. Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Many newcomers just want to get acquinted with the project, so asking questions early avoids many problems later. The project is fast paced and ever evolving, so even people that have been around a long time might have questions.   </p>
<p>Those who are asked or answer a general question should be responsive and helpful, directing people to the appropriate forums or channels is good, but answering the question is more important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be respectful</strong><br />
Disagreement is normal, they can be social or about technical details, but it is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. Allowing frustration to turn into personal attacks is not acceptable.  </p>
<p>A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one, so we will challenge prejudice or hostility that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take responsibility</strong><br />
We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work together to resolve the problem, those involved in the project are expected to resolve disagreements constructively.  </p>
<p>The participants in the project should be able to accept and give constructive criticism, be it positive or negative, this is how we learn to work better.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be collaborative</strong><br />
What we together produce is a <em>complex whole,</em> made of <em>many parts</em> and is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential. To be efficient and effective, and for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each team must make an effort to understand the system as a whole.  </p>
<p>Wherever possible, we work closely with projects in the same space and others in the Ethereum community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.   Collaboration at all levels improves the quality of our work and we value it both internally and externally.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discuss &amp; communicate</strong><br />
Our community values discussion, information and decisiveness. We all lead by example, both in discussion and in action.<br />
We want to encourage new participants to feel empowered to take action, to experiment when they feel like their innovation could improve the project and at times to lead.  </p>
<p>Sometimes not all of the data is available to everyone or a consensus on how to act can't be reached, but a decision must still be made. Not every participant will always agree on everything, but once a decision is made, it should be respected, accepted and work continued to achieve the common goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give credit where credit is due</strong><br />
Some members may be more visible than others, but good ones use their visibility to highlight the great work of others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We invite any- and everybody to participate in any aspect of the project. Our community is open and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required commitment, capacity and competence.</strong></p>
