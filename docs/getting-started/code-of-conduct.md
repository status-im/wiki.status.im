# Code of Conduct

This page will outline how you should govern yourself when participating in the Status community. For more practical tips and suggestions on how to help the project and contribute, please refer to either of these guides: [How to grow our Community](../community/how-to-grow-our-community.md) or [Introduction for developers](../docs/contributing/development/introduction.md).  

The Code of Conduct serves to establish guidelines on how to conduct your behavior. All of us are responsible for maintaining and developing this shared environment.

We want to have a productive, collaborative, and socially responsible space. We hope that all of our community members share our views and nurture this spirit and culture in their dealings with the Status community.    


## Community
Status is about showing respect and humanity for one another. The word itself captures the spirit of social esteem in a community.

We want to nurture a productive and agile environment that welcomes new ideas in a complex and nascent field. In striving to improve with each development cycle, it's imperative to foster collaboration between groups that have unique needs, interests, and skills.

We derive strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. Our Code of Conduct exists to ensure that these groups and individuals collaborate cohesively to their mutual advantage and enjoyment.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or private whenever Status.im is being judged. We expect everyone that represents the project officially or informally, or claims affiliation with it will honor our Code of Conduct.


## We strive to:

- **Reciprocate**   
It is important to show appreciation for everyone contribution, regardless of how big or small it may be. We reciprocate by saying thank you, making a contribution ourselves, or paying it forward.

- **Be considerate**   
Any decision that we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions. After all, our work will be used by others and in turn, we depend on them. This reciprocal obliges us to think of others that will be affected by our decisions.

   When someone leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that will minimize disruption. They should inform people they're leaving and take proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

- **Feel free to ask**  
If there's something you don't know, ask! Questions are always encouraged; no one is expected to know everything. Many newcomers just want to get acquainted with the project and asking questions sooner than later avoids many problems down the road. The project is fast-paced and evolving, so even people that have been around for a while might have questions!

   If asked, be responsive and helpful. Answer or help in any way that you can.

   The more engagement, the better!  

- **Be respectful**  
Disagreement is normal. It can be social about technical details. However, it's never an excuse for poor manners. Work together to resolve a conflict, assume the others good intentions, and do your best to act in an empathic fashion. Frustration should *never* devolve into personal attacks.  

   A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We will challenge any prejudice or hostility that could jeopardize the participation of anyone in the project and the project itself.

   Participants in the project should be able to accept and provide **constructive** criticism. It's how we learn and work better.

- **Take responsibility**  
We all make mistakes. When we do, it's imperative that we take responsibility for them. If you make a mistake, accept it and work to rectify it. Ask questions if need be. In the same vein, if someone is harmed or offended, listen carefully and work together to resolve the problem. 

- **Be collaborative**  
What we produce together is a *very* complex whole that is made up of *many* parts - the sum of our dreams. Collaboration between teams that have their own goals and visions is paramount. Each team must make an effort to understand the system as a whole to be efficient and effective. 

   Wherever possible, we work closely with projects that are in the same space. We prefer to be transparent and try to involve interested parties as early as possible. Collaboration at all levels will improve the quality of our work and see the realization of our goals.

- **Discuss & communicate**  
We value discussion, information, and decisiveness. We lead by example in discussion and action. Encourage new participants to feel empowered to act when they see a problem, experiment with new ideas that could improve the project, and lead. 

   Sometimes, not all of the data is available to everyone. Other times, there will be difficulty achieving a consensus on how to proceed. Not every participant will agree on everything, but when a decision is agreed upon, it should be respected and accepted. Work should continue to achieve a common goal.

- **Give credit where credit is due**  
Some members may be more visible than others. Great members will use their visibility to highlight the great work of others. Recognize each others hard work and success.

**We invite everyone to participate in any aspect of the project they desire. Our community is open, and responsibility can be taken by any contributor who demonstrates the required commitment, capacity, and competence.**
