Ethereum everywhere. A world computer in your pocket. It is so many cool and amazing things that is difficult to know where to start. Being entirely too overwhelmed with the awesomeness that is an Ethereum light client running on your mobile phone, I suppose we\u2019ll just begin at the beginning.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the app, installed it and opened it, it should take you into a chat with Console: a dApp that lives inside status and lets you set up your account and control all the important stuff (as well as a bunch of other rad features, which we will get to in good time).\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, I have already been chatting a fair bit with Console (friends, yay!!). The UI concept here is that when someone sends an action message requesting (in this case) a password, or money, or a confirmation code etc., you can tap the blue block and it will insert the appropriate syntax to respond to that request, followed by your input. \n\n\nOne other thing to note is the \u2018Available\u2019 beneath \u2018Console\u2019 in the top left. This means that my phone has synced with the ropsten testnet (unbelievable right?!). I am running android 7.0 and am doing so over wifi. It took just under 40mins for me to sync, though there are varying reports coming in to our slack depending on phone, OS and network differences. Still, ~40min sync time on a mobile is just insane. Thanks Zsolt for the amazing \nLES\n!\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that you can optionally give your phone number to help status sync with your existing contacts. This is not mandatory and the app will work fine without it. If you do provide it, please make sure to give your country code (so +27\u2026 for me) so that status can send you the confirmation message. Note that if you run into any issues, you can just shake your phone and this should bring up a screen that allows you to submit an error report directly to the status team. You can select from the options what you want to do, but generally it seems best to \nReport a Problem\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to select a colour to indicate the severity of the issue on the second screen above. I really want to make sure that Jarrad, Carl and the crew are on their toes, so I have gone for red here.

This is how the team prefers you to submit bug reports as it is enormously helpful with seeing exactly what went wrong and so providing insight into where to go to fix the issue.

Go you!\n\n\nActually Using the App\n\n\nOK, now that we have the setup out the way, we can get into the really fun stuff. Once you have generated your account with Console, you can open both the ropsten testnet faucet and the status test faucet to get some shweet test ether into your account so that you can go out and convince actual people to be your friends too. Please do not open an issue if this doesn\u2019t happen - we can\u2019t convince people to like you (even if you do use the best tech around).\n\n\nTo open both faucets, tap the hamburger menu with the blue dot to the left of the chat box:\n\n\n\n\nIn words, we tap the menu on the left, scroll down and select the faucet option and then select which testnet we want to get ether from. Repeat this twice to open both faucets and you should get a bit more ether a bit more quickly. Don\u2019t worry about the web3 stuff in the first screenshot - we\u2019ll get to that (who said you can\u2019t build suspense in a technical user guide?).\n\n\nSeeing as we\u2019re now finished chatting to Console for the moment, we can hit the back button and this will take us into the Chats page:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see all the lovely people that you have been chatting to. It\u2019s really straightforward and intuitive, so behave as you normally would in WhatsApp or WeChat etc. Tapping a conversation will take you into it, and you can use the bottom three tabs to navigate through the Chats, Discover and Contacts screen. You can also just swipe right. Just do you.\n\n\nThere is another important dApp that lives here as well - your wallet. Selecting it should take you to a screen like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe main screen opens what is essentially an in-app browser that will show your main balance. You can scroll that screen down using the small down arrow at the top in the centre to see the actual transactions in a chat-like interface. As you can see, I am super rich - absolutely rolling in that test ether - and have sent some to Jarrad as mad props for building the app, and received some from Roland as a little test.\n\n\nIf you navigate back out of the wallet chat and swipe right, or select the Discover tab at the bottom, you will get to the Discover page:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see hashtags people are using and discover all the different conversations going on. Swipe right through the cards to see the most popular categories, or scroll down to see the most recent updates. If you want to make a message of your own appear here, you need to open your profile page and edit your status with the hashtag you want to see appear here. Start a meme or hop onto an existing one - it\u2019s all up to you. You can get to your profile page by tapping the little hamburger menu in the very top left of the app:\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t stress about the \nSettings\n tab - that will be functional in a later release. Your profile page should look like the below. To edit it, hit the three dots in the top right:\n\n\n\n\nTap next to your name to edit that, tap your status to edit that and hit the pencil icon by the picture to upload your own. Remember to include that hashtag if you want it to appear on the Discover page.\n\n\nOnce that is all done and you\u2019ve broadcast a status for all the world to see, swipe right once more (or use the tabs for navigation) and you will get to the Contacts page. Here you will see the dApps that are currently living in status as well as all the wonderful people you have connected with:\n\n\n\n\nThese dApps all work in essentially the same way as the wallet - you can open a chat with them, which will direct you to an in app browser that displays whatever is appropriate for that app. There is a small down arrow at the top which you can scroll down to see any transactions that have occurred between you and the dApp. Directly from within status - signed, sealed and delivered, it all just works. Mind-boggling, I know.\n\n\n\n\nIf you close your app or otherwise have an issue, when you reopen it, you should be directed to  a screen which looks like the below. Select the account that belongs to you (in the case where you set up more than one) and then put in the appropriate password and you should get back to the chat screen:\n\n\n\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work for you or your account doesn\u2019t appear like mine, hit the \nRecover access\n button at the bottom of the first screen and follow the prompts to input the 12 word passphrase console gave you when you first set stuff up and your password.\n\n\nHappy sailing!\n\n\nFor the Adventurous\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered all the basic functionality as it stands, but there is so much more that you can do with status. Most of this stuff will only become available in the beta release or after, but developers around the world should be getting really excited to start building dApps to live alongside Flight Delays and Maker etc. \n\n\nThough it is by no means complete yet, you can do a lot more than just set you account up using Console - it is, after all, a full dApp of its own. Go back to that chat and type \nweb3.\n (the fullstop is important) and \nweb3.eth.\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see a whole bunch of suggestions for the sorts of things you can do directly from Console, the most basic of which is \nweb3.eth.blockNumber\n which will return the current block number on the ropsten testnet. If this doesn\u2019t blow your mind, I\u2019m not sure what will. There are, as I said, still improvements to be made here regarding technical things like retaining state between messages, but it will get there.\n\n\nIf you want to dive in even further and help develop the app, contribute some code or otherwise get involved in the technical side of things, here are the links you need:\n\n\nHow to build it: \nhttps://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/building-status/\n\n\nThe latest nightlies: \nhttp://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/\n\n\nIf you would like to help us with how to build for Linux and Windows, please do feel free - that would be really awesome to get everyone up to the same speed.",

            "text": "FAQ\n\n\nWhy a Messenger?\n\n\nWhen Carl \n Jarrad looked at how to achieve mass adoption for a client. We looked at things such as where the people are, how they behave on their devices, time spent on pc vs mobile - as of 2014 more time is spent on mobile than desktop, and of that time - a THIRD of it is spent within Instant Messengers.\n\n\nInstant Messengers have the highest retention rates, that is when you purchase an install, they become sticky and typically users won't immediately uninstall. \n\n\nThe average user lifetime sky rockets once their friends are involved. When you start thinking about this as a user base and how to connect that with Ethereum, things like payments and applications built ontop of Ethereum integrated into a converstional interface starts becoming like a clear path forward.\n\n\nUltimately we're building a hybrid browser and messenger for us to have the best chance to cast the widest net and focus on user acquisition, staying agnostic and as close as possible to the principles Ethereum embodies.\n\n\nDoes Status support DApps that have their own web page ?\n\n\nYes, we absolutely support DApps on their own webpage and are striving for SWARM support also. Chances are, if a DApp works in Mist or MetaMask it is likely to work in Status!\n\n\nOur goal is to be a DApp browser for Android \n iOS, in addition to this we'll support a Chat API if you wish to integrate within a chat context.\n\n\nIf your web-based DApp renders on mobile, trying using the \n!browse\n command inside a chat and navigating to your DApp URL! During our alpha release, DApp developers can also add their DApps as default contacts by following \nthese instructions\n, but in later releases these will be discoverable to uses through the Discover feature.\n\n\nCan your app be launched with a link?\n\n\nNot at the moment, the standard we will likely support is \nEIP67\n.\n\n\nDo I have to run go-ethereum myself or on server?\n\n\nStatus includes \ngo-ethereum\n and connects directly to the Ethereum network. All you need to do is run the Status app! This is possible to do with the new Light Client Protocol.\n\n\nWhen did you start coding and how you are funded?\n\n\nStatus is largely self-funded.  We've been working on it since prior Devcon1, and we were awarded a Devgrant to port EthereumJ to Android prior to that.\n\n\nEthereumJ has different goals, its developers intended for server use and had no interest in supporting the light client protocol, another large factor is we wanted largely a single codebase for multiple platforms, we had Java running on iOS and Android, we want unify the GUI but the means to do that (JavaFX) is really not suited to mobile devices. \n\n\nOur current approach allows us to get bleeding edge tech and stability of geth whilst maintaining a single codebase.\n\n\nI am new to Ethereum \n Blockchain. I would like to contribute to the project, where would you suggest I start?\n\n\nTo get up to speed with Ethereum, here are a few resources to get you started:\n\n\nEthdocs.org\n,\n\nEthereum.org\n, \n\nEthereum Stack Exchange\n, and \n\nEthereum on Youtube\n\n\nFor Status - please take a look under the \nContributing Section\n, and ask us about it \non Slack\n (we're friendly people!)\n\n\nI have a DApp that runs on Mist how can I test it in Status?\n\n\nSo each chat context has a command !browse - allowing users to access a webview (you can imagine this as a bit like a browser tab), so much in the same way as mist. In terms of integration/compatibility nothing is required on your end to do that if it already works in Mist.\n\n\nThat said, looking beyond the alpha, we'll have developer tooling, and a way for DApp developers to have profiles for theirs DApps (this then makes them discoverable through the 'Discover' feature), along with the Chat API for Developers who want to integrate through a conversational UI rather than (or in addition to) webview.\n\n\nWhat is the \"jail\" in your status-react code?\n\n\nWhen the Chat API is ready to use, your javascript code is executed in Otto VM  \nhttps://github.com/robertkrimen/otto\n  this is the same javascript engine \ngo-ethereum\n uses. That way your code is executed in a \"jail\" and shouldn't interfere with the rest of Status. At least, that's the theory, at the moment we have no implementation of the halting problem, but we will.\n\n\nFor web DApps, we rely on the webview to correctly jail javascript.\n\n\nWhen can we expect to see the Beta?\n\n\nThe first release of our alpha was at the very beginning of Q1 2017, beta will come end of Q1 or early Q2 2017 with developer tooling, bug fixes \n the ability for DApps to integrate within a chat context.\n\n\nIs it going to be for Android only?\n\n\nNo, we support Android \n iOS.\n\n\nIs it possible to install Status \n how can I test?\n\n\nAt the moment you have to \nbuild it yourself\n, we are just fixing some bugs before first alpha release to the early access subscribers which signed up on our website \nhttps://status.im\n - alternatively there are some binaries floating around the Slack now.\n\n\nSoon we'll have our alpha test on Google Play \n Testflight. Currently Status has been tested on:\n\n\n\n\nLG Nexus 5X\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Nexus\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy A3\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy A5\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge\n\n\nMotorola G3\n\n\niPhone 5\n\n\niPhone 6S\n\n\niPhone 7\n\n\n\n\nWhat languages do you support?\n\n\nWe\u2019re currently supporting 30 languages\u200a\u2014\u200athis includes; English, \u5b98\u8a71, \u5b98\u8bdd, \u5ee3\u6771\u8a71, \u4e0a\u6d77\u8bdd, Nederlands, Fran\u00e7ais, Deutsch, \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940, Magyar, Italiano, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4, Polski, Portugu\u00eas brasileiro, Portugu\u00eas europeu, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, Slovenski, Espa\u00f1ol, Espa\u00f1ol (Latin-America), Swahili, Svenska, Suisse fran\u00e7aise, Schweizerdeutsch, Svizzera Italiana, \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22, T\u00fcrk\u00e7e, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648 \n Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t!\n\n\nIf you see a typo, mistranslation or something missing, don't hesitate to let us know \nvia the Status Slack\n, or fix it yourself using our \nTranslation Guide!\n\n\nWhat about all these permissions in the app?\n\n\nPermissions are always a hot topic for apps, we hate the way we\u2019re doing them too. The good news is it\u2019s only like this for alpha and in production we\u2019ll make permission usage on-demand. At the moment there\u2019s many moving parts and a bunch of react-native dependencies (and Instabug) which don\u2019t have code to ask on-demand. Thanks for understanding!\n\n\nContacts, SMS, Telephone\n\u200a\u2014\u200athese are for an optional step of phone contact synchronisation. We don\u2019t use them unless you tap on the phone sync request message.  \n\n\nLocation\n\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrently used for our toy !location command. Our aim is to provide this to DApps For things like sharing location with friends, ordering food, or self-driving cars.  \n\n\nMicrophone\n\u200a\u2014\u200aIn this version, we don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s there because we intended to send audio messages over Whisper, in practice this was a bad idea. We still intend to offer Audio messages in Beta so it\u2019s going to stay. It is also used in Instabug which we use to collect feedback.  \n\n\nStorage\n\u200a\u2014\u200aWe need a place to put the blockchain data.  \n\n\nCamera\n\u200a\u2014\u200aWe use this for setting your profile picture and for reading QR codes.  \n\n\nWhere are the nightlies?\n\n\nHere you go!\n\nhttp://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/",

            "text": "Introduction\n\n\nIn this post, you will learn what the two main languages used in Status are, how to learn them, how to build Status, \n finally how to find tasks to work on.\n\n\nStatus is largely written in two languages: Clojurescript \n Golang and builds on React Native for UI. I'll talk about the rational behind these design decisions and link to offsite resources on learning each of these technologies.\n\n\nReact Native\n\n\nStatus (formerly known as Syng) has always aspired to have a single, unified codebase for multi-platform development. This is not so easy to achieve, as many of the non-web-based solutions out there allow you to have a semi-single codebase, but you find yourself creating a lot of seperate logic for handling user interfaces on each platform - Status is 80% frontend code and this presents a problem. We tried Xamarin \n Java (EthereumJ was the first implementation we got running on Android \n iOS - via RoboVM), and we quickly discovered this problem.\n\n\nMobile apps built on web-based technologies, such as those done in Cordova, are great for short-term projects or mvp, but you will quickly run into performance issues on resource-limited devices and may need to rewrite you app. In our tests displaying webview DApps in a chat history with iFrames and all the other bells and whistles we wanted turned out to be a futile effort.\n\n\nThat limited our options to choosing between NativeScript \n React Native. We chose React Native because it is more mature and is being used in production for popular apps like \nFacebook\n, \nInstagram\n, \nAirbnb\n, \nBaidu\n \n \nDiscord\n. This gave us the impression that this framework was here to stay with many Fortune 500 companies invested in its continuance.\n\n\nAt this point all we had to do is merge Material \n iOS design into our unique look'and'feel so that we could minimise the amount of Android \n iOS specific code. Our amazing designer \nAndrei Mironov\n elegantly solved the rest of that puzzle.\n\n\nReact Native Learning Resources\n\n\nIf you would like to start learning React Native, check out these resources:\n\n\n\n\nUse React Native\n\n\nReact Native Docs\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you might want to continue reading and learn more about \nre-natal\n, \nre-frame\n \n \nreagent\n.\n\n\nClojurescript\n\n\n\u201cLisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.\u201d\n \u2014 \nEric Raymond\n.\n\n\nTo read more quotes on Lisp read \nLisp, made with secret alien technology\n.\n\n\n  \n\n\nThere's alot of resources online about why learning Lisps are so great. For us, it's largely about culture; we like the way Lispers think. We want functional programming, macros, homoiconic code and the flexibility that comes with a simple, unstructured language in which to think. The benefits of this become more apparent in later stage development, where functional language allows us to perform rewrites more easily, isolate many bugs to specific functions, as well as enforcing correct coding. Also, I prefer reading it.\n\n\nMoreover, with \nhiccup\n, working with React Native markup becomes a dream.\n\n\nClojurescript Learning Resources\n\n\nIf you would like to start learning Clojurescript, check out these resources:\n\n\n\n\nClojurescript FAQ (for JavaScript developers)\n\n\nClojurescript Community Resources\n\n\nClojurescript Unraveled Book (Free)\n\n\n/r/clojure\n \n \n/r/clojurescript\n\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\nOf all the Ethereum implementations \ngo-ethereum\n has received the most love and implements the newest and best features. Without \ngo-ethereum\n we couldn't use the light client protocol and Status would not be possible. We will also get access to Swarm the fastest. We consume \ngo-ethereum\n as a library in \nstatus-go\n.\n\n\n'Nough said.\n\n\nRe-natal\n\n\nre-natal is an invaluable tool to that automates the setup of your \nre-frame\n React Native for Android \n iOS, it includes \nfigwheel\n for easy development.\n\n\n\n\nre-natal \nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nRe-frame\n\n\nre-frame is simple but expressive library for writing Single Page Applications in ClojureScript, using \nReagent\n. It is a functional framework for reactive 'MVC-style' applications. To learn more:\n\n\n\n\nre-frame \nREADME.md\n\n\nre-frame \ndocs\n\n\nA Noob's walkthrough of a re-frame Application\n\n\nThe Angular Phonecat tutorial in re-frame\n\n\n\n\nReagent\n\n\nReagent\n provides a minimalistic interface between ClojureScript and React. It allows you to define efficient React components using nothing but plain ClojureScript functions and data, that describe your UI using a Hiccup-like syntax.\nThe goal of Reagent is to make it possible to define arbitrarily complex UIs using just a couple of basic concepts, and to be fast enough by default that you rarely have to care about performance.\n\n\n\n\nReagent website\n\n\nReagent \nREADME.md\n\n\nBuilding Single Page Apps with Reagent\n\n\nYou should be using Figwheel \n Reagent. Here's why\n\n\nReagent Rocks\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Status\n\n\nRead our guide on how to Build Status\n\n\nFinding issues to work on\n\n\nSo by now you should have a general sense of the tech that goes into Status, managed to get Status built \n running and want to find something to sink your teeth into. \n\n\nThe best place to look for tasks to work on is our \nGithub Issues\n. We've labelled the tasks by our estimated difficulty.\n\n\nClick the labels below to see what is available.\n\n\nBeginner Issues\n\n\n\n\nThese are tickets we believe anyone willing to learn Clojurescript can handle. They involve minor UI and localisation changes. Even though they may seem minor that have a huge impact on the usability of Status.\n\n\nIntermediate Issues\n\n\n\n\nBeginner too easy and your Clojure-fu up to par? Time to level up!\nThese issues require a slightly deeper understanding of what Status is trying to accomplish; an understanding of Ethereum; and more communication and intimacy in the Slack as they are interdependent tasks. They involve things like setting up UI tests, fixing nastier bugs and making decisions that will have a real impact on how Status behaves and functions.\n\n\nAdvanced Issues\n\n\n\n\nThese issues are really there for people deeply into Ethereum, Core Contributors and people who believe in Status and have the skills to make magic happen.",

            "text": "Status (formerly known as Syng) has always aspired to have a single, unified codebase for multi-platform development. This is not so easy to achieve, as many of the non-web-based solutions out there allow you to have a semi-single codebase, but you find yourself creating a lot of seperate logic for handling user interfaces on each platform - Status is 80% frontend code and this presents a problem. We tried Xamarin   Java (EthereumJ was the first implementation we got running on Android   iOS - via RoboVM), and we quickly discovered this problem.  Mobile apps built on web-based technologies, such as those done in Cordova, are great for short-term projects or mvp, but you will quickly run into performance issues on resource-limited devices and may need to rewrite you app. In our tests displaying webview DApps in a chat history with iFrames and all the other bells and whistles we wanted turned out to be a futile effort.  That limited our options to choosing between NativeScript   React Native. We chose React Native because it is more mature and is being used in production for popular apps like  Facebook ,  Instagram ,  Airbnb ,  Baidu     Discord . This gave us the impression that this framework was here to stay with many Fortune 500 companies invested in its continuance.  At this point all we had to do is merge Material   iOS design into our unique look'and'feel so that we could minimise the amount of Android   iOS specific code. Our amazing designer  Andrei Mironov  elegantly solved the rest of that puzzle.",

To read more quotes on Lisp read  Lisp, made with secret alien technology .      There's alot of resources online about why learning Lisps are so great. For us, it's largely about culture; we like the way Lispers think. We want functional programming, macros, homoiconic code and the flexibility that comes with a simple, unstructured language in which to think. The benefits of this become more apparent in later stage development, where functional language allows us to perform rewrites more easily, isolate many bugs to specific functions, as well as enforcing correct coding.

We truly value contributions that help to improve our documentation; whether that be tutorials for users, additions to the FAQs, or more granular instructions for developers - it all adds up and our community appreciates it :)\n\n\nOur Wiki is powered by MKDocs, and is on: \nhttps://github.com/status-im/wiki.status.im\n, and if you spot any errors, find parts of the documentation confusing, or have some suggestions on how we could have clearer communication we'd love your help, and feel free to let us know via the \nStatus Slack\n.\n\n\nDocumenting Guide\n\n\nIt's fairly difficult to write a general documentation guide as how you document stuff will depend on what it is you are trying to explain. The most basic stuff to know is that MKDocs uses markdown as it's primary language, although you can also write your guides using inline HTML as well. Please go \nhere\n for more detailed info on this, as well as a look at how the file structure of our docs works.\n\n\nGetting Set Up\n\n\nYou need to have both python and pip set up on your machine to install MKDocs. You can find all the information for how to do that and what versions are required \nhere\n. I had python already intalled on my machine, but needed to get pip:\n\n\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\nIt seemed like using \nsudo\n was important otherwise the mkdocs install failed with some nasty stack trace, but that may have been specific to my environment (Mac). Once you have got that all working and  \n\n\nmkdocs --version\n \n\n\nreturns an answer (currently \nmkdocs, version 0.16.1\n), then you can clone into the status repo and get going.\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/status-im/wiki.status.im.git\n \n\n\n(or \ngit clone git@github.com:status-im/wiki.status.im.git\n if you have your SSH keys set up) followed by \n\n\ncd wiki.status.im\nmkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\nYou should then be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000 or http://127.0.0.1:8000 and see the changes you are making to the wiki as you make them. Magic!\n\n\nGeneral Notes on What We Look For\n\n\nGenerally speaking, we like a lot of screenshots and less language as this helps us to guide people all over the world who may not all speak the same languages. Take a look at our \nUser Guide\n for a rough outline of what we mean by balancing your text with screenshots and other helpful images. \n\n\nAs you can see from our \ngithub repo\n all of the different documents are kept in the \ndocs\n directory. Click through to there to find the section and then the specific document you are wanting to add to or edit, or make a new file for documentation that you feel is missing. \n\n\n\n\nIn the top level repo, you can also see an \nmkdocs.yml\n file, which is what controls how and where each document appears. If you are adding a new document, you will need to speak to Jarrad, Carl or another team member to figure out where it belongs, but either way you will need to edit this file in order for it to appear. It is definitely best to communicate with the core team before diving this deep though.\n\n\nAs you can see, I have uploaded a bunch of images into this post (which is largely about encouraging you to use lots of images in your own documentation and explainers). The images are all kept in the \nimg\n directory in each folder within the \ndocs\n directory. You cannot upload straight to these \nimg\n folders as that requires push access to the whole repo, but you can make your own fork of \nwiki.status.im\n and upload the images there to be merged by the team once you have completed your awesome work. To do all this, navigate to the folder you are working in and click the \nFork\n option in the very top right. This will start a new fork of the wiki in your own repo, where you can upload the photos and then later push back to status to be merged.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have forked it and selected where it should go in your profile, you can then add images easily by either dragging and dropping or uploading directly from your machine.\n\n\n\n\nYou can select the first radio button option to commit the uploaded images you need directly onto your own master branch. From there, once you are sure that all the changes you have made are the ones you want to make and look good on the wiki via that neat trick with\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n\n\nthen you can submit a PR to the actual status wiki:\n\n\n\n\nClick the highlighted button near the top right and follow the instructions from there to submit your changes to the status team. You should see a screen something like this where you can review all the changes you have made before actually submitting. For the PR, I have uploaded the photos needed for this post, made two grammatical changes to the User Guide and, obviously enough, uploaded this entire \ndocumenting.md\n file, all of which I can review easily. \n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for adding to our wonderful, free (libre) open source, community-driven effort to bring Ethereum to the people!\n\n\nDocumentation Guidelines\n\n\nThese will evolve as the project does, but really depends on what specific type of documentation you are looking to help out with. For technical documentation, examples and lots of code is what we are primarily looking for; by way of example see the first set up section of this article. For instance, in order to add an image here, you can either use inline html (my preferred option because it is easier to positiona dn style) or the normal markdown way of doing things. The images above are inserted like so:\n\n\ncenter\nimg src=\"../img/status-wiki.png\" /\n/center\n \n\n\nand style tags etc can be added really easily:\n\n\ncenter\nimg src=\"../img/status-wiki.png\" style=\"width:300px\" /\n/center\n\n\nor you can just do it in normal markdown:\n\n\n[![We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics.

First off, I have decided to help out with the translation to Wooki, so have called my file wo.cljs. Please give the two letters used to represent your language and make sure to include the .cljs file extension (as a lot of status is written in clojure and clojurescript). If your language doesn\u2019t have a two letter identifier, or you are doing a dialect, then use the fr_ch.cljs example as your template. Second, make sure that you update the first line. In this example, I have copy-pasted the Afrikaans file and changed .af to .wo to match what I called my file.\n\n\nYou can then get translating - as you can see by my exact translation of members-title to the Wooki equivalent.\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done all the translations, all you really need to do is propose the file, review the changes you have made, submit the PR and the team should be able to handle it from there. Please see below for a fully illustrated version of those last two steps if you need it.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate an Existing Translation\n\n\nIf your language already appears in this repo, but you would like to see some stuff change because it\u2019s wrong or impolite or gets its tense all mixed up, then click on the file in question and submit a PR from there. Seeing as I\u2019m South African, I\u2019m going to take on the Afrikaans translation and submit a PR which the team will then decide to merge or not, depending on how \nlekker\n they think my \ntaal\n is.\n\n\nYou want to select the file and then click on the pencil edit icon near the top right:\n\n\n\n\nThis should open a file on your fork of the project, which will allow you to edit it as you please and submit the changes to the status team, who can review it, decide if they like your changes and then merge it back from your newly-created fork into the main repo. I know it sounds a bit complex, but this is awesome for versioning software, controlling changes, edits, and conflicts and makes much more sense once you do it a bit yourself. Your edit page should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\nAs I have indicated, I am going to edit \"en jy\" to \u201cen u\u201d because it is more formal and polite (if you speak Afrikaans, you know that this is contextually incorrect, but bear with me while I illustrate the concept here).\n\n\nOnce you are happy with all the changes you have made, scroll down and hit the green button to propose them. This should take you to a screen where it will highlight in red what the file used to say and highlight in green what you have changed it to. Please review your changes here in full and then hit the other green button in the top left to submit the PR:\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s it.

Ethereum everywhere. A world computer in your pocket. It is so many cool and amazing things that is difficult to know where to start. Being entirely too overwhelmed with the awesomeness that is an Ethereum light client running on your mobile phone, I suppose we\u2019ll just begin at the beginning.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the app, installed it and opened it, it should take you into a chat with Console: a dApp that lives inside status and lets you set up your account and control all the important stuff (as well as a bunch of other rad features, which we will get to in good time).\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, I have already been chatting a fair bit with Console (friends, yay!!).

This means that my phone has synced with the ropsten testnet (unbelievable right?!). I am running android 7.0 and am doing so over wifi. It took just under 40mins for me to sync, though there are varying reports coming in to our slack depending on phone, OS and network differences. Still, ~40min sync time on a mobile is just insane. Thanks Zsolt for the amazing \nLES\n!\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that you can optionally give your phone number to help status sync with your existing contacts. This is not mandatory and the app will work fine without it. If you do provide it, please make sure to give your country code (so +27\u2026 for me) so that status can send you the confirmation message. Note that if you run into any issues, you can just shake your phone and this should bring up a screen that allows you to submit an error report directly to the status team. You can select from the options what you want to do, but generally it seems best to \nReport a Problem\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to select a colour to indicate the severity of the issue on the second screen above. I really want to make sure that Jarrad, Carl and the crew are on their toes, so I have gone for red here. Hitting the forward button (top right) should take you to where the magic really happens:\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the \nTake a screen recording\n button in the bottom left. This is how the team prefers you to submit bug reports as it is enormously helpful with seeing exactly what went wrong and so providing insight into where to go to fix the issue. You can enter your email, take a video and go ahead and submit. At which point we issue you a massive thank you for being such a stellar alpha tester. Go you!\n\n\nActually Using the App\n\n\nOK, now that we have the setup out the way, we can get into the really fun stuff. Once you have generated your account with Console, you can open both the ropsten testnet faucet and the status test faucet to get some shweet test ether into your account so that you can go out and convince actual people to be your friends too. Please do not open an issue if this doesn\u2019t happen - we can\u2019t convince people to like you (even if you do use the best tech around).\n\n\nTo open both faucets, tap the hamburger menu with the blue dot to the left of the chat box:\n\n\n\n\nIn words, we tap the menu on the left, scroll down and select the faucet option and then select which testnet we want to get ether from. Repeat this twice to open both faucets and you should get a bit more ether a bit more quickly. Don\u2019t worry about the web3 stuff in the first screenshot - we\u2019ll get to that (who said you can\u2019t build suspense in a technical user guide?).\n\n\nSeeing as we\u2019re now finished chatting to Console for the moment, we can hit the back button and this will take us into the Chats page:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see all the lovely people that you have been chatting to. It\u2019s really straightforward and intuitive, so behave as you normally would in WhatsApp or WeChat etc. Tapping a conversation will take you into it, and you can use the bottom three tabs to navigate through the Chats, Discover and Contacts screen. You can also just swipe right. Just do you.\n\n\nThere is another important dApp that lives here as well - your wallet. Selecting it should take you to a screen like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe main screen opens what is essentially an in-app browser that will show your main balance. You can scroll that screen down using the small down arrow at the top in the centre to see the actual transactions in a chat-like interface. As you can see, I am super rich - absolutely rolling in that test ether - and have sent some to Jarrad as mad props for building the app, and received some from Roland as a little test.\n\n\nIf you navigate back out of the wallet chat and swipe right, or select the Discover tab at the bottom, you will get to the Discover page:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see hashtags people are using and discover all the different conversations going on. Swipe right through the cards to see the most popular categories, or scroll down to see the most recent updates. If you want to make a message of your own appear here, you need to open your profile page and edit your status with the hashtag you want to see appear here. Start a meme or hop onto an existing one - it\u2019s all up to you. You can get to your profile page by tapping the little hamburger menu in the very top left of the app:\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t stress about the \nSettings\n tab - that will be functional in a later release. Your profile page should look like the below. To edit it, hit the three dots in the top right:\n\n\n\n\nTap next to your name to edit that, tap your status to edit that and hit the pencil icon by the picture to upload your own. Remember to include that hashtag if you want it to appear on the Discover page.\n\n\nOnce that is all done and you\u2019ve broadcast a status for all the world to see, swipe right once more (or use the tabs for navigation) and you will get to the Contacts page. Here you will see the dApps that are currently living in status as well as all the wonderful people you have connected with:\n\n\n\n\nThese dApps all work in essentially the same way as the wallet - you can open a chat with them, which will direct you to an in app browser that displays whatever is appropriate for that app. There is a small down arrow at the top which you can scroll down to see any transactions that have occurred between you and the dApp. Directly from within status - signed, sealed and delivered, it all just works. Mind-boggling, I know.\n\n\n\n\nIf you close your app or otherwise have an issue, when you reopen it, you should be directed to  a screen which looks like the below. Select the account that belongs to you (in the case where you set up more than one) and then put in the appropriate password and you should get back to the chat screen:\n\n\n\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work for you or your account doesn\u2019t appear like mine, hit the \nRecover access\n button at the bottom of the first screen and follow the prompts to input the 12 word passphrase console gave you when you first set stuff up and your password.\n\n\nHappy sailing!\n\n\nFor the Adventurous\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered all the basic functionality as it stands, but there is so much more that you can do with status. Most of this stuff will only become available in the beta release or after, but developers around the world should be getting really excited to start building dApps to live alongside Flight Delays and Maker etc. \n\n\nThough it is by no means complete yet, you can do a lot more than just set you account up using Console - it is, after all, a full dApp of its own. Go back to that chat and type \nweb3.\n (the fullstop is important) and \nweb3.eth.\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see a whole bunch of suggestions for the sorts of things you can do directly from Console, the most basic of which is \nweb3.eth.blockNumber\n which will return the current block number on the ropsten testnet. If this doesn\u2019t blow your mind, I\u2019m not sure what will. There are, as I said, still improvements to be made here regarding technical things like retaining state between messages, but it will get there.\n\n\nIf you want to dive in even further and help develop the app, contribute some code or otherwise get involved in the technical side of things, here are the links you need:\n\n\nHow to build it: \nhttps://wiki.status.im/contributing/development/building-status/\n\n\nThe latest nightlies: \nhttp://artifacts.status.im:8081/artifactory/nightlies-local/\n\n\nIf you would like to help us with how to build for Linux and Windows, please do feel free - that would be really awesome to get everyone up to the same speed.",

We encourage  constructive  criticism and friendly debate, as long as it remains  friendly .    Find other ways to reward contributors, either through your own words, actions or material.    Actively highlight and communicate your mistakes  and  accomplishments, be accepting of those who do. The faster mistakes are discovered the faster we can solve them, and the faster we can praise your accomplishments.    Any rewards should not be based on tasks but rather on consistent performance. Rewards should be impromptu.    Adding task-contingent rewards (for doing or finishing a task) to an interesting task causes people to be less interested and successful in the task. (This effect is larger for monetary rewards than for prizes, status rewards and charitable donations.)",

Consider the following before attempting the following sections:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you run everything in a elevated command prompt (Right-click a link to Cmd.exe or Cygwin and click 'Run as Administrator')\n\n\nDo not use the ./re-natal symlink. Write your own \nre-natal.sh\n script that uses full relative paths, give it execution permissions with \nchmod +x\n, and use it instead. Script:\n\n\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nrequire('coffee-script/register');\nrequire('./node_modules/re-natal/index.js');\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the root \npackage.json\n edit \n\"./postinstall.sh\"\n to \n\"postinstall.sh\"\n\n\nAny \nnpm install\n commands (except for \nnpm install -g\n global commands) should be done as follows, to avoid windows symlink problems: \nnpm install --no-bin-links\n\n\nDo not use Cygwin for \nnpm install\n commands, use cmd.exe.\n\n\nReact-native is not bug-free. If you run into an error like \nerror: bundling: UnableToResolveError: Unable to resolve module...\n, the guaranteed solution is to manually edit the \nrequire()\n statements to the full relative path. E.g. \n(crypt = require('crypto'))\n becomes \n(crypt = require('../../../../node_modules/crypto/package.json'))\n.\n\n\n\n\nDependencies \n Setup\n\n\n$ git clone git@github.com:status-im/status-react.git -b master \n cd status-react\n# or\n$ git clone git@github.com:status-im/status-react.git -b develop \n cd status-react\n\n$ lein deps \n npm install \n ./re-natal deps \n lein generate-externs \n ./re-natal use-figwheel \n lein re-frisk use-re-natal \n ./re-natal enable-source-maps\n$ mvn -f modules/react-native-status/ios/RCTStatus dependency:unpack\n$ cd ios \n pod install \n cd ..\n\n\n\nBuilding Status for Release\n\n\n# fill in store file properties in android/gradle.properties\n$ lein prod-build\n$ react-native run-android --variant=release\n# for iOS, build in Xcode\n\n\n\nBuilding Status for Development\n\n\n$ lein prod-build\n\n$ ./re-natal use-android-device \ndevice\n # (genymotion, real or avd)\n# or\n$ ./re-natal use-ios-device \ndevice\n # (simulator or real)\n\n$ ./re-natal use-figwheel\n\n# new tab, run figwheel REPL\n$ BUILD_IDS=\"ios,android\" lein repl\n\n# new tab, run react native packager\n$ react-native start\n\n# FOR ANDROID\n# new tab, enable communication to react-native, figwheel and re-frisk debugging\n$ adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081\n$ adb reverse tcp:3449 tcp:3449\n$ adb reverse tcp:4567 tcp:4567\n$ react-native run-android\n\n# FOR IOS\n# Attention: We will shortly be upgrading to React Native 0.4x\n# Until then you need to be running Xcode 8.2.1 or lower to build for ios\n$ react-native run-ios\n\n\n\nAccess Geth on Device\n\n\nadb forward tcp:8545 tcp:8545\nbuild/bin/geth attach http://localhost:8545\n\n\n\nContributing\n\n\nPlease make sure your contributions adhere to our coding guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nCode must be idiomatic Clojure, please refer to the \nstyle guidelines\n (i.e. use \nlein eastwood\n\n \n \nlein kibit\n).\n\n\nCode must be documented.\n\n\nPull requests need to be based on and opened against the \ndevelop\n branch.\n\n\nCommit messages should be prefixed with the root namespace(s) under \nstatus-im\n that they modify.\n\n\ne.g. \"contacts, ios: add contact stylistic changes\"\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nOnly Github is used to track issues.

And that\u2019s exactly what we want! With more developers with a broad range of experiences and backgrounds, we\u2019ll have a richer ecosystem of DApps for users and a better Web 3.0.\n\n\nHowever, many developers then come with \nquestions which arise logically\n from their other development experience \u2014 but questions which long-time blockchain users might not think of. In this article, we just want to give some background information to clear up some of these questions. If any of your questions aren\u2019t answered, please come raise them on the Status \nSlack\n, and we might be able to address them in future articles.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a decentralized app?\n\n\nOne way to think of a blockchain is as a decentralized database. When you run a node in the blockchain, you\u2019re hosting a local copy of this database. When this aspect of the blockchain became clear, developers naturally began to think of uses for the database other than validating transactions (as on Bitcoin).\n\n\nIn Ethereum, much of the business logic of your application, as well as transaction history, gets stored on the blockchain. For instance, if you made a fantasy football DApp, you\u2019d \ncreate a smart contract\n, an address on the blockchain that can send and receive funds programmatically. You\u2019d program your DApp to send and receive funds only in certain ways and under certain conditions. You\u2019d allow your users to send funds to this smart contract to place their bets,  and the smart contract would lock the funds in place until the football scores were available from a trusted source, and then pay out to the winner.\n\n\nAlready, in a very important sense, your app is decentralized! No central server stores your users\u2019 data, and no central server makes the decisions about routing and handling money. All this happens on the blockchain, as Ethereum runs the code in your smart contract.\n\n\nOkay, how would my users access this app?\n\n\nSo now the backend of your app is decentralized. But what about your frontend \u2014 HTML, JavaScript, CSS? And how can your users access this backend?\n\n\nHere\u2019s what used to happen. You\u2019d get a server, on DigitalOcean for instance. You\u2019d download some implementation of the Ethereum network \u2014 a client like geth (Go-Ethereum) \u2014 so that your server can connect to and make calls to the Ethereum blockchain. You\u2019d build your frontend any way you normally build your front end: React, Meteor, heck you can go all Web 1.0 with just HTML and minimal JS if you want. You serve that frontend on your server by making it available at a port and configuring your DNS to point to that address, the way you normally do.\n\n\nThen, using the \nWeb3.js library\n, your app would make calls to the geth network running on your server. Just as any web app sends info to, or gets info from, a database, your application will call your smart contract. In this way, your users access your app like any other web page, and your server accesses the decentralized part of your app.\n\n\nWait, so who\u2019s storing my app?\n\n\nWell. If you just write a simple smart contract, Mist Wallet will also allow you to publish it to the Ethereum network (by compiling it to Ethereum Virtual Machine code, and then making it live on the network). In the future, Status will also allow you to publish to the Ethereum network from your mobile phone.\n\n\nBut neither Mist nor Status is storing the business logic of your app. That lives on the blockchain, and is served and stored peer-to-peer. Spookily, it\u2019s everywhere and nowhere!\n\n\nAnd I have to set up an Ethereum node to access the backend?\n\n\nTo save you the trouble of setting up an Ethereum node, the fine folks at Ethereum and ConsenSys have come up with two solutions, and Status now provides a third mobile-based solution. The \nMist browser\n, the MetaMask plugin for Chrome, and the \nStatus mobile app\n all handle making the calls to the Ethereum network. You still use Web.js to program your app, but you don\u2019t have to run a local geth node. As a result, if your users are using Mist, MetaMask, or Status, you can provide your app like a normal web page, and your users access it like a normal web page.\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t that mean the front end isn\u2019t decentralized? Is there a decentralized way to host my front end code?\n\n\nAs you astutely point out, the front end is not decentralized at this point in your app development. Some DApps, like \nAragon, are hosting\n the front end both in a centralized and a decentralized way, so you actually can do both at the same time.\n\n\nTo make your front end decentralized as well, you\u2019ll need to \nuse Swarm\n or \nIPFS\n. These are distributed file servers. Swarm is actually one of the \ncore Ethereum technologies\n, while IPFS is an \nindependent file system\n. To use a distributed file server, your website needs to be packaged as a single file.\n\n\nFortunately, as you probably know, the latest and greatest in web application technology is Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. Examples include \nMeteor\n, which plays very well with Reactive approaches to programming a complex webapp. As a result, you can build your web page, then package it up into a single file, and then publish it to Swarm or IPFS. This process still isn\u2019t as easy or seamless as it should be and will be soon.\n\n\nYour users will access your DApp with \u201cwww\u201d if you host it on a centralized server (such as DigitalOcean or Amazon S3 or whatever), and with \u201cbzz://\u201d for Swarm, or \u201cfile://\u201d for IPFS.\n\n\nIf you publish your front end in a decentralized way, your DApp really is full-stack decentralized, with both front and back ends being served from peer-to-peer networks. There are \nmany reasons\n to prefer developing with such an architecture, including safety, in some cases speed, and resilience to network attacks or downtime.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\nBecause there aren\u2019t many explicit discussions of web-app vs. DApp hosting and architecture, we just wanted to provide some background information which will aid in understanding future, more practical, tutorials.",

Come ask in the \nSlack\n if you hit bumps!)\n\n\nWeb 3.0 is here! The new distributed web gives new building blocks to developers and entrepreneurs to create new Distributed Apps, or DApps. And Status helps put your DApp in the hands of mobile users across the globe.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we\u2019ll use the Truffle and Embark frameworks to create a basic DApp ready for further development, and we\u2019ll deploy it on mobile using Status. After we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be ready to continue developing your DApp, and when you eventually go live, your users will be able to access your DApp by browsing through the Status app, the Chrome MetaMask extension, or the Ethereum Mist browser. One development process, three ways of accessing your DApp!\n\n\nA Quick Overview Before We Get Started\n\n\nBroadly speaking, for both Truffle and Embark, you\u2019ll get the Status app running and connected to your computer, either on a simulator or on a real phone. Next, you\u2019ll install some necessary dependencies. Then, you\u2019ll start testrpc, a mini-Ethereum network that runs on your computer. Finally, you\u2019ll install the Status Truffle box or the Status Embark plugin, create a basic demo app, and add it to Status.\n\n\nInstalling Status\n\n\nTo develop on Status, you need to have Status running either:\n\n\n\n\n\n\non a real phone,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin an Android simulator, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin an iOS simulator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can go to \nhttps://test.status.im\n to download for Android. At the time of writing, we\u2019re out of invitations for Testflight iOS, but you can sign up for early iOS access  \non our website\n.\n\n\nIf you are running in an Android simulator, you also need to run on the command line: \nadb forward tcp:5561 tcp:5561\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a smartphone, or you only have an iPhone but want to get started right away, you can build Status yourself for either Android or iOS by following \nthese guidelines\n. Following those guidelines, you can install an Android simulator, or start up Status in the Xcode simulator. Our wiki guidelines should be all you need, but if you get lost come ask around in \nour Slack\n.\n\n\nEnabling Debugging\n\n\n\n\nWith your phone connected, /debug \u201cOn\u201d\n\n\nWe\u2019ll assume you have Status open, and that if you\u2019re using a physical phone it\u2019s connected to your computer. Now we need to enable debugging from within the Status app. After you\u2019re logged in to Status, click on Console and run \n/debug\n, then pick \u201cOn.\u201d You\u2019ll get back a message telling that debugging is on, and that you can use the \nstatus-dev-cli\n tools if you want. You don\u2019t need those right now, because you\u2019ll be using the pre-configured Status Truffle box or the Embark plugin.\n\n\nThe message also shows you your IP address, which you\u2019ll need later for Embark.\n\n\nInstalling Git, Node, and NPM\n\n\nWe\u2019ll use the version control tool Git to install the Truffle and Embark frameworks. If you have Xcode installed, Git is probably already installed. To see if it\u2019s installed, open Terminal or any command line program and just enter \ngit\n. You should see a list of common Git commands. If you don\u2019t, you can install Git with \nthese instructions\n.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll also use node and the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install some dependencies, so make sure you have the latest versions installed. In particular, \ntestrpc\n will complain if you don\u2019t have at least Node 6.9.1.\n\n\nOn OSX, the easiest way to install node is with \nHomebrew\n. You can run \nbrew install node\n, and the check the version with \nnode --version\n.\n\n\nInstalling testrpc\n\n\nTo install testrpc, you just need to enter this on your command line:\n\n\nnpm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s \ntestrpc\n? When you deploy your DApps, you are asking the Ethereum network to create an address for them. When you use your DApps, you pay the Ethereum network for the steps that your code takes. Your DApps talk to the Ethereum network through remote procedure calls, or RPC\u2019s. A local network makes this whole process very fast, so that it\u2019s easy to develop your DApps. Essentially, \ntestrpc\n gives you a small Ethereum network on your computer.\n\n\nFor more about gas and ether, see the top answer on this \nStackExchange question\n.\n\n\nUsing Truffle\n\n\nWhile the steps up till now apply to using both Truffle and Embark, now we\u2019ll cover steps specific to each framework. Let\u2019s start with Truffle. If you just want to use Embark, you can skip to the next section.\n\n\nRunning testrpc\n\n\nIf you try to run \ntruffle migrate\n in the next section without \ntestrpc\n running, it\u2019s going to give you an error. So let\u2019s get it going. Open Terminal or any command line program and enter the command:\n\n\ntestrpc\n\n\nThat\u2019s it! It will show you a list of available accounts, private keys, Wallet, and mnemonic.\n\n\nNow open a new shell (such as a new Terminal window or tab) for the next part. You\u2019ll leave testrpc running in the first window, and use the second window for the rest of the tutorial.\n\n\nInstalling Truffle\n\n\nNow that you have \ntestrpc\n running, and a new shell open, you\u2019ll run:\n\n\nnpm install -g truffle // Version 3.0.5+ required.\n\n\n\nThis installs the Truffle framework, and you can find its GitHub \npage here\n.\n\n\nWith the Truffle framework installed, we can grab the Status Truffle Box, and get a basic DApp running. All the Truffle boxes also include the app frameworks React and Redux, which were designed by Facebook and are widely used by app developers. You can find the other Truffle \nboxes here\n, but for this tutorial you should use the Status Truffle Box, because it\u2019s set up to be added to Status.\n\n\nTo install the Status Truffle box, all you have to do is run this command in the same Terminal window:\n\n\ngit clone [https://github.com/status-im/truffle-box-status.git](https://github.com/status-im/truffle-box-status.git)\n\n\n\nWith the Status Truffle box successfully cloned, let\u2019s walk through the next steps of running your DApp.\n\n\n# Change into the truffle box directory\ncd truffle-box-status\n\n# install the node dependencies\n npm install\n\n\n\n\n\nExample on OS X: testrpc running on the left, and installing Truffle on the right\n\n\n# Compile the contracts from Solidity (much like JavaScript) into\n# runnable EVM code\n truffle compile\n\n# Publish the compiled contracts to your network. testrpc must\n# already be running\n truffle migrate\n\n\n\nAs you run the \nmigrate\n command, you can look at the window with \ntestrpc\n running, and you\u2019ll see your transactions being published to your local network.\n\n\nRunning our Truffle DApp on Status\n\n\nNow we are ready to see our DApp running on Status.\n\n\nFrom within your DApp directory, run:\n\n\n# Run your JavaScript\n npm run start\n\n\n\nThis should tell you that the the app is running, and that the DApp has been added to the Status Contacts.\n\n\n\n\nThe DApp added to the default Contacts\n\n\nAfter you\u2019ve clicked on your DApp within Status, you\u2019ll see that the chat area at the bottom shows \n/browse [http://localhost:](http://localhost:8080/)3000/\n for iOS, and \n/browse [http://10.0.3.2:3000/](http://10.0.3.2:3000/)\n for Android.\n\n\nIn fact, you can also browse to that address from Console with the command \n/browse\n, just like you could browse to any other web address inside Status. You can also enter that address into your browser, and you\u2019ll see the same thing.\n\n\nUsing Embark\n\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered Truffle, let\u2019s take a look at Embark.\n\n\nInstalling Embark and Starting the Network\n\n\nNow that you have Status running and your dependencies installed, you\u2019ll run:\n\n\nnpm -g install embark\n\n\n\nThis installs the Embark framework, and you can find its GitHub \npage here\n.\n\n\nWith the Embark framework installed, we can make a demo DApp:\n\n\nembark demo\n\n#change into the directory\ncd embark_demo\n\n\n\nNext we want to run the network. You can run a full Ethereum node with \nembark blockchain\n, but for development you probably want to run \ntestrpc\n with:\n\n\nembark simulator\n\n\n\nConfiguring our Embark DApp forStatus\n\n\nNow we are almost ready to see our DApp running on Status \u2014 this part is short and easy. Open a new shell tab in the same DApp directory, and run:\n\n\nnpm install embark-status --save\n\n\n\nIn the same directory, open the file \nembark.json\n and edit the \nplugins\n key:\n\n\n\"plugins\": {\n    \"embark-status\": {\n      \"deviceIp\": \"your-device-ip\",\n      \"whisperIdentity\": \"dapp-test\",\n      \"name\": \"MyDapp\"\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\nYou can get the device IP from the Status Console, which was shown after you ran \n/debug \u201cOn\"\n above. For instance, if \n/debug\n told me my IP was \n10.0.3.15\n, the entire \nembark_demo/embark.json\n file would look like this:\n\n\n{\"contracts\": [\"app/contracts/**\"],\n  \"app\": {\n    \"css/app.css\": [\"app/css/**\"],\n    \"images/\": [\"app/images/**\"],\n    \"js/app.js\": [\"embark.js\", \"app/js/_vendor/jquery.min.js\", \"app/js/_vendor/bootstrap.min.js\", \"app/js/**\"],\n    \"index.html\": \"app/index.html\"\n  },\n  \"buildDir\": \"dist/\",\n  \"config\": \"config/\",\n    \"plugins\": {\n \"embark-status\": {\n     \"deviceIp\": \"10.0.3.15\",\n     \"whisperIdentity\": \"dapp-test\",\n     \"name\": \"MyDapp\"\n }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re running Status on Android, enable port forwarding with:\n\n\nadb forward tcp:5561 tcp:5561\n\n\n\nRunning the DApp\n\n\nNow we\u2019re ready to run the DApp on Status. From within your DApp directory, run:\n\n\n# start your DApp\n embark run\n\n\n\nThe Embark console will appear within your shell with useful information about the SimpleStorage contract it has created, compiled, and deployed. It will also tell you that the DApp has been added to Status!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Embark simulator runs in one Terminal window on the top, and the Embark console on the bottom\n\n\nYou should be able to tap the Contacts tab within Status and see your DApp there. After you\u2019ve clicked on your DApp within Status, you\u2019ll see that the chat area at the bottom shows \n/browse [http://localhost:](http://localhost:8080/)8000/\n for iOS, and \n/browse [http://10.0.3.2:8000/](http://10.0.3.2:3000/)\n for Android.\n\n\nIn fact, you can also browse to that address from Console with the command \n/browse\n, just like you could browse to any other web address inside Status. You can also enter that address into your browser, and you\u2019ll see the same thing.\n\n\nYou\u2019re Off to the Races\n\n\nUsing Status, you can now develop mobile DApps as easily as developing for MetaMask or Mist! But Status offers extra goodies as well.\n\n\nIn particular, Status will help you allow your users to chat with your DApp! The chat interface will let your users easily and intuitively accomplish tasks. In the future, your users will be able to hold group conversations where all the other participants are DApps, which is kind of amazing.\n\n\nLater we\u2019ll have an easy mechanism to make your DApp available for others to use on Status, but for now please just submit a pull request using our \nguide on adding DApps\n.",

Come ask in the Slack if you hit bumps!)\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nOne of the first things you\u2019ll notice when you start using Status is that you can send and receive funds just by issuing simple commands.\n\n\n\n\nEasily send or request eth\n\n\nThis is no accident! Today, more people use smartphones than computers, and when people are on their smartphones, they spend a lot of their time in messaging applications. Smartphone users enjoy using messaging to control applications, because it\u2019s simple and convenient.\n\n\nStatus allows users to interact with a wide array of DApps using the same intuitive chat interface. In the near future, Status users will be able to have group chats where most of the participants are DApp chatbots. All DApp developers will benefit from this synergy, because a common chat interface for multiple DApps makes using your DApp more convenient, and effectively makes your DApp more powerful.\n\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll explore how you can use the Status Chat API while developing your DApp on Status to create custom commands for your users. As a result of developing on Status, you\u2019ll have a DApp that your users can access on MetaMask, Mist, and Status \u2014 and that invites mobile users with native mobile commands. With little extra developer time invested, you\u2019ll gain a mobile app.\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, you can \njoin our Slack\n, and download the \nAndroid binary\n. We\u2019d love to chat with you as you get started.\n\n\nDelivering Your Commands to Status\n\n\nThe majority of this tutorial covers the Status Chat API. First, though, let\u2019s touch on how you\u2019ll make your commands available after you\u2019ve written them using the API.\n\n\nTo add a command to your DApp in Status, you\u2019ll write your commands in JavaScript, put them in a file named \ncommands.js\n, and make the file publicly available at \nhttps://yourAwesomeDApp.com/commands.js\n. When your DApp goes live and is added to Status, Status will take the file from that URL and create your commands.\n\n\nIf you decide to use the Truffle or Embark DApp development frameworks, they have standard locations which will put your commands.js file at the right URL. For Truffle, that\u2019s the folder \npublic\n, and for Embark, that\u2019s the folder dist. So in Truffle, you\u2019ll have \npublic/commands.js\n, and in Embark, you\u2019ll have \ndist/commands.js\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommands.js locations on a Mac: Embark on the top, Truffle on the bottom\n\n\nThe file itself will be the same whether you develop with Truffle, with Embark, or a different framework or no framework. You just need to place the file at the right location to make it available during development and after your DApp goes live.\n\n\nDuring development, this location will be part of your local computer file system. If you\u2019re developing with \ntruffle-box-status\n or the \nembark-status\n plugin, you\u2019ll be able to see your DApp on Status at \nlocalhost:8080/commands.js\n (for example), and Status will create your commands the same way. After you\u2019ve finished development, you\u2019ll need to host your DApp in the traditional way or in a decentralized way such as Swarm to make the whole thing publicly available.\n\n\nYour users can see possible commands in one of two ways. If they\u2019re chatting directly with your DApp, they can type a forward slash, \u201c/\u201d, and that will bring up a list of suggestions. Or they can click the bullet point icon to the left of the chat input box. If you haven\u2019t defined any commands, clicking the bullet point list icon will just fill in the command \n/browse\n, which is a globally available Status command.\n\n\nYour users will be able to access your DApp\u2019s commands in a group chat as well, as long as your DApp has been added to the chat. In that case, your commands will show as \n/yourAwesomeDApp/your-command\n.\n\n\nThe Status Commands\n\n\nYou can take advantage of three methods: \nstatus.command()\n, \nstatus.response()\n, and \nstatus.on()\n. These methods (along with a few methods used only by Status) are defined in the \nStatus GitHub repo\n at \nresources/status.js\n, in the \nstatus\n var.\n\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each, and the parameters each command takes. We\u2019ll also build a toy \nhello\n example as we go. For easy reference, you\u2019ll find the code for that example, as well as a summary of the methods and parameters, at the end of this article.\n\n\nstatus.command()\n\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the the most important method available to you, the one that you\u2019ll use for your DApp\u2019s unique commands. You\u2019re allowed to pass up to 12 parameters into \nstatus.command()\n.\n\n\n\n\nname\n. This is what your users will type in following a forward slash to invoke the command. For instance, if you wrote \nname: \u201chello\u201d\n, your user might invoke \n/hello\n.\n\n\ntitle\n. Remember that when your user starts typing a command, a list of suggestions appears. In the list of suggestions, the title appears on the left, above the description.\n\n\ndescription\n. Similarly, in the list of suggestions, the description appears on the left, below the title.\n\n\ncolor\n. This parameter defines the background color of the name of your command as it appears in the list of suggestions. Give commands different colors to help your users easily distinguish commands, and to harmonize with your DApp\u2019s brand and color scheme.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that these first four parameters control how your command will appear to your users in the list of suggestions. In addition, the \nname\n parameter gives your users a way to invoke your command. Here\u2019s an example of the first four parameters defining a \n/hello\n command:\n\n\nstatus.command({\n name: \u201chello\u201d,\n title: \u201cHelloBot\u201d,\n description: \u201cHelps you say hello\u201d,\n color: \u201c#7099e6\u201d,\n});\n\n\n\n\n\npreview\n. This option defines what your user will see as a result of \ntheir\n action, before any other response. The \npreview\n parameter takes a function, which should return a \nstatus.component\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you use the command \n/location\n, from the Mailman DApp on Status, you\u2019ll see a preview of a geographic location. This command is intended to send the user\u2019s location to someone else, and so it doesn\u2019t depend on the recipient\u2019s response.\n\n\nTo continue with our \nhello\n example, you could add to the parameters you\u2019ve already written above:\n\n\npreview: function () {\n return status.components.text({}, \u201cyou\u2019re saying hello\u201d);\n },\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss the \nstatus.components\n \u2014 there are only seven! \u2014 in the next section, after covering the other parameters to \nstatus.command\n.\n\n\n\n\nshort-preview\n. While \npreview\n controls how your command appears within your DApp\u2019s chat, the \nshort-preview\n parameter controls how your commands get shown in the list of chats, before your users tap on your chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicon\n. Suppose your user is interacting with your command. Each command can have a custom icon to appear in the command preview. For instance, if you request ETH from someone, a green two-way arrow appears in the preview. Or you can look again at the result of the \n/location\n command in the picture above. Next to \n/location\n, and above the map, there\u2019s a small pin icon. Both are examples of command icons, another way to improve your design for your users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparams. This important option is where you define possible inputs to your command. It requires an array holding an object, with possible parameters \nname\n, \nplaceholder\n, \nsuggestions\n, and one of the \nstatus.types\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example, which you might add to your \n/hello\n command:\n\n\nparams: [{\n name: \u201chello\u201d,\n type: status.types.TEXT\n placeholder: \"Why not say hello\"\n}],\n\n\n\nThese \nparams\n are available in any parameter, including in \nparams\n itself. For instance, if your users sends \n/hello whatsup\n, the input \nwhatsup\n will be available in your command under \nparams.hello\n.\n\n\nNaturally, the \ntype\n dictates what sort of data your users may input. The available Status types are: \nstatus.types.TEXT\n, \nstatus.types.NUMBER\n, \nstatus.types.PHONE\n, and \nstatus.types.PASSWORD\n.\n\n\n\n\nNotice the placeholder \u201cType your password\u201d\n\n\nThe \nplaceholder\n parameter here only applies if your users haven\u2019t put any input into the command, not even the name of the command. You can use it to include helpful guidance where necessary. This parameter will probably prove useful if you end up using \nstatus.response()\n, one of the other methods available to you, which we\u2019ll cover in another section.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you enter /faucet, two suggestions pop up.\n\n\nAs another parameter inside \nparams\n, you can also include \nsuggestions\n for your users\u2019 input. This should return a component to be rendered.\n\n\nFor instance, if you are using the Console DApp and you select the \n/faucet\n command, you\u2019ll see two suggestions to choose from.\n\n\nLet\u2019s add this idea to our \nhello\n example:\n\n\nparams: [{\n name: \u201chello\u201d,\n type: status.types.TEXT\n suggestions: helloSuggestions\n}],\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s simple, but what\u2019s \nhelloSuggestions\n? Let\u2019s make a function, which will return a \nscrollView\n that will hold two suggestions: \u201cHello\u201d, and \u201cGoodbye\u201d. Don\u2019t get intimidated by the length, there\u2019s actually not much to it.\n\n\n*// Three little helpers - don't worry about them, they're just for\n// style.*\n\nfunction suggestionsContainerStyle(suggestionsCount) {\n    return {\n        marginVertical: 1,\n        marginHorizontal: 0,\n        keyboardShouldPersistTaps: true,\n        height: Math.min(150, (56 * suggestionsCount)),\n        backgroundColor: \"white\",\n        borderRadius: 5,\n        flexGrow: 1\n    };\n}\nvar suggestionSubContainerStyle = {\n    height: 56,\n    borderBottomWidth: 1,\n    borderBottomColor: \"#0000001f\"\n};\n\nvar valueStyle = {\n    marginTop: 9,\n    fontSize: 14,\n    fontFamily: \"font\",\n    color: \"#000000de\"\n};\n\n*// The main star of our show! It will return two touchable buttons.*\n\nfunction helloSuggestions() {\n    var suggestions = [\"Hello\", \"Goodbye\"].map(function(entry) {\n        return status.components.touchable(\n            {onPress: [status.events.SET_VALUE, entry]},\n            status.components.view(\n                suggestionContainerStyle,\n                [status.components.view(\n                    suggestionSubContainerStyle,\n                    [\n                        status.components.text(\n                            {style: valueStyle},\n                            entry\n                        )\n                    ]\n                )]\n            )\n        );\n    });\n\n*// Let's wrap those two touchable buttons in a scrollView*\nvar view = status.components.scrollView(\n        suggestionsContainerStyle(2),\n        suggestions\n    );\n\n*// Give back the whole thing inside an object.*\nreturn {markup: view};\n}\n\n\n\nThe main point of this example is that your \nsuggestions\n parameter should accept users\u2019 input, and then return a component to be rendered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuggestionsTrigger\n. Now that we\u2019ve covered \nparams\n and the possibility of \nsuggestions\n, it\u2019s easy to see that \nsuggestionsTrigger\n will take a string corresponding to an event which triggers showing suggestions. If you don\u2019t include this parameter, the default is \n\"on-change\"\n, so your suggestions will show when your users select the command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfullscreen\n. If your command has suggestions, this param controls whether that list of suggestions expands to fill the entire screen. If your command has a lot of suggestions, you might want set \nfullscreen\n to true, so that your users don\u2019t have to pull the list upwards. On the other hand, if your command has only a few suggestions and you set \nfullscreen\n to true, your users will have to pull the list downwards to keep it from hiding the screen. Choose whichever will be most convenient to your users, considering your command\u2019s suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/send\u2019s validator function says \u201cla la la\u201d is not a valid amount of ETH!\n\n\n\n\nvalidator\n. This parameter allows you to check your users\u2019 input before sending off the command. It takes a function, which should return an error if the input is invalid.\n\n\n\n\nYou can easily see an example if you try to send an amount of ETH that\u2019s not a number! To continue with our \n/hello\n example, you might write something like:\n\n\nvalidator: function(params) {\n if (!params.hello) {\n   return status.components.text({}, \u201cSay hello\u201d);\n   }\n }\n\n\n\nThis will raise an error if your user doesn\u2019t input a string. Notice that you should return your message inside one of the \nstatus.components\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhandler\n. Of course, you probably want the command to do something when your users call it! The \nhandler\n parameter takes a function to accomplish this. For instance, suppose your user inputs \n/hello howdy\n. \u201cHowdy\u201d is a valid string, and will pass the \nhello\n validator. From there, your \nhandler\n could take over to send this greeting to another user:\n\n\nhandler: web3.shh.post(params.hello),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t provide a \nhandler\n, your user will issue the command and then see the \npreview\n, but nothing else will happen.\n\n\nThe Status Components\n\n\nThere aren\u2019t many of these components, and you\u2019ll feel very comfortable with them if you\u2019re at all familiar with React. The \nscrollView\n, \nwebView\n, \ntext\n, \nimage\n, \nview\n, and \ntouchable\n take standard React props (each of those underlined words is linked). \nvalidationMessage\n is a custom Status component that just takes two strings, and will return them wrapped in text components inside a \nview\n. Here\u2019s a list, taken straight from the Status code:\n\n\ncomponents: {\n view: view,\n text: text,\n image: image,\n touchable: touchable,\n scrollView: scrollView,\n webView: webView,\n validationMessage: validationMessage\n }\n\n\n\nstatus.response()\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve covered all the parameters for \nstatus.command()\n, you can easily understand \nstatus.response()\n. This method takes the same parameters that \nstatus.command()\n does. The difference is that with this method you can actively ask a user to issue a command.\n\n\nFor example, the Status DApp Wallet allows you to \n/request\n money. In that case, the person you\u2019re requesting money from will see the result of \nstatus.response(send)\n \u2014 they\u2019ll be asked to give a command, \n/send\n, in response to your \n/request\n command.\n\n\nThe Wallet example illustrates that as a DApp developer, you may wish to use \nstatus.command()\n and \nstatus.response()\n together to create dialogues of commands. You could also use \nstatus.response()\n by itself to prompt your users to enter necessary information as part of the onboarding process for your DApp.\n\n\nBecause \nstatus.command()\n and \nstatus.response()\n take the same parameters, you can sometimes use nearly the same code for both of them. You simply have to consider when you want to ask a user to issue a command, and when you want to just make the command available. Most of the time, you\u2019ll use \nstatus.command()\n.\n\n\nTo return to our \nhello\n example, if we used all the same code inside our method but used \nstatus.response()\n, a user would be asked to respond to another user\u2019s greeting. Hello back!\n\n\nstatus.on()\n\n\nThe method \nstatus.on()\n allows your DApp to respond to events. This method requires an event name as a string, and a callback function. For instance, you might define:\n\n\nstatus.on(\u201cinit\u201d, function(params, context) {\n status.sendMessage(\u201cHello, man!\u201d);\n});\n\n\n\nWith the \n\"init\"\n option, your DApp will trigger \nstatus.sendMessage()\n when the Status app loads your DApp \u2014 your DApp will greet your users even before they have clicked on it. Other options include \n\u201ctext-change\u201d\n and \n\u201cmessage\u201d\n.\n\n\nThat\u2019s All For Now, Folks\n\n\nPlease join other DApp developers in \nour Slack\n in the #dapp-chat or #dev-status channels.\n\n\nFinally, here\u2019s the TL;DR of what we\u2019ve covered.\n\n\nstatus.command()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n:string\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n:string\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription\n:string\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor\n:string, containing valid hex color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreview\n:function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicon\n:string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparams\n:array holding object with parameters \nname\n, \ntype\n, \nplaceholder\n, and \nsuggestions\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuggestionsTrigger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfullscreen\n:boolean. If not included, default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalidator\n:function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhandler\n:function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshort-preview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample \ncommands.js\n file to create \nhello\n command:\n\n\nstatus.command({\n name: \u201chello\u201d,\n title: \u201cHelloBot\u201d,\n description: \u201cHelps you say hello\u201d,\n color: \u201c#7099e6\u201d,\n preview: function () {\n   return status.components.text({}, \u201cyou\u2019re saying hello\u201d);\n   },\n params: [{\n   name: \u201chello\u201d,\n   type: status.types.TEXT\n   suggestions: helloSuggestions\n    }],\n  suggestionsTrigger: 'on-change',\n  fullscreen: false,\n  validator: function(params) {\n    if (!params.hello) {\n      return status.components.text({}, \u201cSay hello\u201d);\n      }\n     },\n  handler: web3.post.shh (params.hello)\n\n});\n\n\n\nStatus Components\n\n\nStandard React Native components, except for \nvalidationMessage\n, which just wraps standard components.\n\n\ncomponents: {\n view: view,\n text: text,\n image: image,\n touchable: touchable,\n scrollView: scrollView,\n webView: webView,\n validationMessage: validationMessage\n }\n\n\n\nstatus.response()\n\n\nTakes all the same parameters as \nstatus.command()\n. Use \nstatus.response()\n to ask a user to issue a command, whether in response to another command, or as part of your DApp setup.\n\n\nstatus.on()\n\n\nRequires an event name as a string, and a callback function.",

Smartphone users enjoy using messaging to control applications, because it\u2019s simple and convenient.  Status allows users to interact with a wide array of DApps using the same intuitive chat interface. In the near future, Status users will be able to have group chats where most of the participants are DApp chatbots. All DApp developers will benefit from this synergy, because a common chat interface for multiple DApps makes using your DApp more convenient, and effectively makes your DApp more powerful.  In this guide, we\u2019ll explore how you can use the Status Chat API while developing your DApp on Status to create custom commands for your users. As a result of developing on Status, you\u2019ll have a DApp that your users can access on MetaMask, Mist, and Status \u2014 and that invites mobile users with native mobile commands. With little extra developer time invested, you\u2019ll gain a mobile app.  If you haven\u2019t already, you can  join our Slack , and download the  Android binary .

First, though, let\u2019s touch on how you\u2019ll make your commands available after you\u2019ve written them using the API.  To add a command to your DApp in Status, you\u2019ll write your commands in JavaScript, put them in a file named  commands.js , and make the file publicly available at  https://yourAwesomeDApp.com/commands.js . When your DApp goes live and is added to Status, Status will take the file from that URL and create your commands.  If you decide to use the Truffle or Embark DApp development frameworks, they have standard locations which will put your commands.js file at the right URL. For Truffle, that\u2019s the folder  public , and for Embark, that\u2019s the folder dist. So in Truffle, you\u2019ll have  public/commands.js , and in Embark, you\u2019ll have  dist/commands.js .    commands.js locations on a Mac: Embark on the top, Truffle on the bottom  The file itself will be the same whether you develop with Truffle, with Embark, or a different framework or no framework. You just need to place the file at the right location to make it available during development and after your DApp goes live.  During development, this location will be part of your local computer file system. If you\u2019re developing with  truffle-box-status  or the  embark-status  plugin, you\u2019ll be able to see your DApp on Status at  localhost:8080/commands.js  (for example), and Status will create your commands the same way.

This command is intended to send the user\u2019s location to someone else, and so it doesn\u2019t depend on the recipient\u2019s response.

For instance, if your users sends  /hello whatsup , the input  whatsup  will be available in your command under  params.hello .  Naturally, the  type  dictates what sort of data your users may input. The available Status types are:  status.types.TEXT ,  status.types.NUMBER ,  status.types.PHONE , and  status.types.PASSWORD .   Notice the placeholder \u201cType your password\u201d  The  placeholder  parameter here only applies if your users haven\u2019t put any input into the command, not even the name of the command. You can use it to include helpful guidance where necessary. This parameter will probably prove useful if you end up using  status.response() , one of the other methods available to you, which we\u2019ll cover in another section.   After you enter /faucet, two suggestions pop up.  As another parameter inside  params , you can also include  suggestions  for your users\u2019 input. This should return a component to be rendered.  For instance, if you are using the Console DApp and you select the  /faucet  command, you\u2019ll see two suggestions to choose from.  Let\u2019s add this idea to our  hello  example:  params: [{\n name: \u201chello\u201d,\n type: status.types.TEXT\n suggestions: helloSuggestions\n}],  That\u2019s simple, but what\u2019s  helloSuggestions ? Let\u2019s make a function, which will return a  scrollView  that will hold two suggestions: \u201cHello\u201d, and \u201cGoodbye\u201d. Don\u2019t get intimidated by the length, there\u2019s actually not much to it.  *// Three little helpers - don't worry about them, they're just for\n// style.*\n\nfunction suggestionsContainerStyle(suggestionsCount) {\n    return {\n        marginVertical: 1,\n        marginHorizontal: 0,\n        keyboardShouldPersistTaps: true,\n        height: Math.min(150, (56 * suggestionsCount)),\n        backgroundColor: \"white\",\n        borderRadius: 5,\n        flexGrow: 1\n    };\n}\nvar suggestionSubContainerStyle = {\n    height: 56,\n    borderBottomWidth: 1,\n    borderBottomColor: \"#0000001f\"\n};\n\nvar valueStyle = {\n    marginTop: 9,\n    fontSize: 14,\n    fontFamily: \"font\",\n    color: \"#000000de\"\n};\n\n*// The main star of our show! It will return two touchable buttons.*\n\nfunction helloSuggestions() {\n    var suggestions = [\"Hello\", \"Goodbye\"].map(function(entry) {\n        return status.components.touchable(\n            {onPress: [status.events.SET_VALUE, entry]},\n            status.components.view(\n                suggestionContainerStyle,\n                [status.components.view(\n                    suggestionSubContainerStyle,\n                    [\n                        status.components.text(\n                            {style: valueStyle},\n                            entry\n                        )\n                    ]\n                )]\n            )\n        );\n    });\n\n*// Let's wrap those two touchable buttons in a scrollView*\nvar view = status.components.scrollView(\n        suggestionsContainerStyle(2),\n        suggestions\n    );\n\n*// Give back the whole thing inside an object.*\nreturn {markup: view};\n}  The main point of this example is that your  suggestions  parameter should accept users\u2019 input, and then return a component to be rendered.    suggestionsTrigger . Now that we\u2019ve covered  params  and the possibility of  suggestions , it\u2019s easy to see that  suggestionsTrigger  will take a string corresponding to an event which triggers showing suggestions. If you don\u2019t include this parameter, the default is  \"on-change\" , so your suggestions will show when your users select the command.    fullscreen . If your command has suggestions, this param controls whether that list of suggestions expands to fill the entire screen. If your command has a lot of suggestions, you might want set  fullscreen  to true, so that your users don\u2019t have to pull the list upwards. On the other hand, if your command has only a few suggestions and you set  fullscreen  to true, your users will have to pull the list downwards to keep it from hiding the screen. Choose whichever will be most convenient to your users, considering your command\u2019s suggestions.     /send\u2019s validator function says \u201cla la la\u201d is not a valid amount of ETH!   validator . This parameter allows you to check your users\u2019 input before sending off the command. It takes a function, which should return an error if the input is invalid.   You can easily see an example if you try to send an amount of ETH that\u2019s not a number! To continue with our  /hello  example, you might write something like:  validator: function(params) {\n if (!params.hello) {\n   return status.components.text({}, \u201cSay hello\u201d);\n   }\n }  This will raise an error if your user doesn\u2019t input a string. Notice that you should return your message inside one of the  status.components .    handler . Of course, you probably want the command to do something when your users call it! The  handler  parameter takes a function to accomplish this. For instance, suppose your user inputs  /hello howdy . \u201cHowdy\u201d is a valid string, and will pass the  hello  validator. From there, your  handler  could take over to send this greeting to another user:  handler: web3.shh.post(params.hello),    If you don\u2019t provide a  handler , your user will issue the command and then see the  preview , but nothing else will happen.",

This method takes the same parameters that  status.command()  does. The difference is that with this method you can actively ask a user to issue a command.  For example, the Status DApp Wallet allows you to  /request  money. In that case, the person you\u2019re requesting money from will see the result of  status.response(send)  \u2014 they\u2019ll be asked to give a command,  /send , in response to your  /request  command.  The Wallet example illustrates that as a DApp developer, you may wish to use  status.command()  and  status.response()  together to create dialogues of commands. You could also use  status.response()  by itself to prompt your users to enter necessary information as part of the onboarding process for your DApp.  Because  status.command()  and  status.response()  take the same parameters, you can sometimes use nearly the same code for both of them. You simply have to consider when you want to ask a user to issue a command, and when you want to just make the command available. Most of the time, you\u2019ll use  status.command() .  To return to our  hello  example, if we used all the same code inside our method but used  status.response() , a user would be asked to respond to another user\u2019s greeting. Hello back!",

Combined Works\n\n\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na)\n Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\nthe Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb)\n Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\ndocument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\nexecution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\nthese notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\ncopies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n Do one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n0)\n Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\nLicense, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\nsuitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\nrecombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\nthe Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\nmanner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\nCorresponding Source.\n\n\n1)\n Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\nLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that \n(a)\n uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and \n(b)\n will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne)\n Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\nyou use option \n4d0\n, the Installation Information must accompany\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\nCode. If you use option \n4d1\n, you must provide the Installation\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Combined Libraries\n\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n\n\n\na)\n Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n\nb)\n Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL EXCEPTION GRANTED BY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n\n\nAs a special exception, copyright holders give you permission to link this\nlibrary with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of\nthe license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute\nthe resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also\nmeet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of\nthe license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not\nderived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you must\nextend this exception to your version of the library.\n\n\nNote: this exception relieves you of any obligations under sections 4 and 5\nof this license, and section 6 of the GNU General Public License.",
