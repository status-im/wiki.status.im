# Mission & Core Values

On our mobile devices today, more time is spent in messenger apps than in any other type of application.  Mobile devices will be - and in many cases already are - where people do most, if not all, of their personal computing.  Status is an encrypted and decentralized messaging application that frees users from both third party surveillance and the mining of metadata in their social graph.  
More than an instant messenger, Status is a platform that allows anyone with a capable smartphone to use decentralized applications (DApps) right from their mobile device.  

**Join us in putting Ethereum on every mobile device on the planet.**


## The Mission

- To ease the transition to a more open mobile internet.

- To help anyone, anywhere interact with Ethereum, and to make Web 3.0 available to the average smartphone user.

- Status fosters links with the wider Ethereum DApp community and showcases what the ecosystem has to offer.

To achieve our mission we intend to employ a strategy that contains three core components: 

*Technology* + *Community* + *User Acquistion*

### Technology

- Status is built using ClojureScript, React, and Golang. It includes a geth node on your device that uses the Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES) to validate and sync with the blockchain. It uses Whisper (shh) as its messaging client and aims to integrate Swarm for storage.

- To sync with and validate the Ethereum blockchain on a mobile device, Status deploys a geth node using the Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES).

- Status’ messages are transmitted using the Whisper (shh) protocol.

- Status aims to integrate Swarm for storage.
  

### Developer / Contributor Community

- We aim to help anyone who is keen to learn about and/or contribute to the community's effort.

- As a community, we strive to welcome and encourage those who are (as we so recently were) new to the paradigm of massively concurrent permissionless peer-to-peer networks.


- We approach all contributions with an open mind and respect for the opinions of our fellow developers.

- The Status Development community actively explores and experiments with the latest Ethereum technologies in the ongoing drive to provide the best possible user experience.

- We aim to foster an environment conducive to easy, intuitive, and consistent learning. We want to foster innovation at every level.

### User Community / Aquisition

- Status will not compromise the sovereignty and security of user data.

- We offer an intuitive entry point into decentralized, encrypted, peer-to-peer networks that are maintained by a large and diverse group of developers.

#### Marketing campaigns 
    + DApp developers 
    + User acquisition for mass adoption



## Beliefs 

- Status.im believes in an open Internet. Built not only on open protocols, but upon Free/Libre software where the costs (financial or otherwise) of participation are negligible for **all**. 

- Status is founded on the belief that communication is at the heart of human social (and economic) life; and that society thrives through direct interaction rather than intermediation.  Status can pave the way towards **conversational crypto-commerce.** 

- We believe that systems like Ethereum have the potential to improve the very fabric of our society.  Status.im should solve the problem of giving **ordinary people** across the globe easy access to the power and promise of Ethereum and Web 3.0.  

- Status.im is passionate about distributed and decentralized technology in general, and about the advantages of Ethereum’s *public Blockchain* in particular.  

- We believe that people should directly control the use of their personal data as well as the history of their social interactions.  We imagine the benefits to **all** of a future where distributed and decentralized applications make proprietary intermediaries and centralized services (which exploit their users) obsolete.  

- Communication, decision making, and control should be clear and transparent to everyone in the community.

- Our work is driven by a belief that Ethereum and public blockchains can yield great benefits to society, and access to DApps and Ethereum should be made available to **anyone**, anywhere.

## Core Values

- Reciprocity, open-mindedness, respect, and encouragement.

- The systems we're creating must be open, permissionless, award fair access and *Distribute, Decentralize, and Democratize power*.

- Status is licenced as Free Libre & Open Source software (FLOSS), which allows **anyone** to run the software for **any purpose** as well as to **study**, **modify**, and **distribute** the software and any adapted versions.
